		In this article, we study the relation between the universal deformation rings and big Hecke algebras in the residually reducible case. Following the strategy of Skinner-Wiles and Pan's proof of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, we prove a pro-modularity result. Based on this result, we also give a conditional big $R=\mathbb{T}$ theorem over some totally real fields, which is a generalization of Deo's result.</div>

		We systematically study relative and absolute ${\Delta}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+$-crystals on the (log-) prismatic site of a smooth (resp.~ semi-stable) formal scheme. Using explicit computation of stratifications, we classify (local) relative crystals by certain nilpotent connections, and classify (local) absolute crystals by certain enhanced connections. By using a $p$-adic Riemann--Hilbert functor and an infinite dimensional Sen theory over the Kummer tower, we globalize the results on absolute crystals and further classify them by certain small (global) $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+$-local systems.</div>

		Kantor's Thesis was the first step in unifying the Chabauty-Kim and Lawrence-Venkatesh methods via relative completion. In this work, we refine Kantor's approach by addressing its limitations, achieving the first unification where a dimension inequality between local and global Galois cohomology implies Diophantine finiteness for curves. This results in a new conditional proof of Faltings' and Siegel's theorems and introduces a novel p-adic analytic method for computing rational points on hyperbolic curves, offering advantages over the Chabauty-Kim and Lawrence-Venkatesh approaches.
  Our technical contributions are threefold. First, we establish the density of Kantor's p-adic period map. Second, our method applies to all curves of genus g >= 2, extending beyond the specific modular curves considered in Kantor's thesis. Third, we resolve the representability problem for Kantor's global Selmer stack. Previously, Kantor's method required additional conjectures in p-adic Hodge theory to represent his Selmer stack--a priori a rigid analytic stack--in a category with a suitable dimension theory. We overcome this by replacing the unipotent completions used in Kim's framework with the unipotent radicals of Kantor's relative completions, derived from monodromy representations associated with the relative cohomology of a Kodaira-Parshin family.
  Kantor's method is a step toward the Effective Faltings Problem, which seeks not only to establish finiteness of rational points on hyperbolic curves but to compute them explicitly. While the Lawrence-Venkatesh method is unconditional, it has not yet been made effective for any curve. In contrast, the Chabauty-Kim method, though conditional, has been made effective in various settings. Our Unipotent Chabauty-Kim-Kantor method addresses key challenges in Kantor's program and highlights its potential for both theoretical and computational advances.</div>

		For $i\in \{1,2,3\}$, let $E_i(x)$ denote the error term in each of the three theorems of Mertens on the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers. We show that for each $i\in \{1,2\}$, the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the condition $\int_2^X E_i(x)\,\mathrm{d}x>0$ for all $X>2$, and we examine assumptions under which the equivalence also holds for $i=3$. In addition, we generalize this to analogues of Mertens' theorems concerning prime sums twisted by quadratic Dirichlet characters or restricted to arithmetic progressions.</div>

		Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of $q$ elements. We define the Rudin-Shapiro function $R$ on monic polynomials $f=t^n+f_{n-1}t^{n-1}+\dots + f_0\in\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ by

		Ramanujan investigated maximal order for the number of divisors function by introducing some notion such as (superior) highly composite numbers. He also studied maximal order for other arithmetic functions including the sum of powers of divisors function. In this paper we relate zero-free regions for the Riemann zeta-function to maximal order for the sum of powers of divisors function. In particular, we give equivalent conditions for the Riemann hypothesis in terms of the sum of the $1/2$-th powers of divisors function. As a by-product, we also give equivalent conditions for the Riemann hypothesis in terms of the partial Euler product for the Riemann zeta-function.</div>

		Given a finite abelian group $\Gamma$, we study the distribution of the $p$-part of the class group $\operatorname{Cl}(K)$ as $K$ varies over Galois extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ with Galois group isomorphic to $\Gamma$. We first construct a discrete valuation ring $e\mathbb{Z}_p[\Gamma]$ for each primitive idempotent $e$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p[\Gamma]$, such that 1) $e\mathbb{Z}_p[\Gamma]$ is a lattice of the irreducible $\mathbb{Q}_p[\Gamma]$-module $e\mathbb{Q}_p[\Gamma]$, and 2) $e\mathbb{Z}_p[\Gamma]$ is naturally a quotient of $\mathbb{Z}_p[\Gamma]$. For every $e$, we study the distribution of $e\operatorname{Cl}(K):=e\mathbb{Z}_p[\Gamma] \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}_p[\Gamma]} \operatorname{Cl}(K)[p^{\infty}]$, and prove that there is an ideal $I_e$ of $e\mathbb{Z}_p[\Gamma]$ such that $e\operatorname{Cl}(K) \otimes (e\mathbb{Z}_p[\Gamma]/I_e)$ is too large to have finite moments, while $I_e \cdot e\operatorname{Cl}(K)$ should be equidistributed with respect to a Cohen--Lenstra type of probability measure. We give conjectures for the probability and moment of the distribution of $I_e\cdot e\operatorname{Cl}(k)$, and prove a weighted version of the moment conjecture in the function field case. Our weighted-moment technique is designed to deal with the situation when the function field moment, obtained by counting points of Hurwitz spaces, is infinite; and we expect that this technique can also be applied to study other bad prime cases. Our conjecture agrees with the Cohen--Lenstra--Martinet conjecture when $p\nmid |\Gamma|$, and agrees with the Gerth conjecture when $\Gamma=\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. We also study the kernel of $\operatorname{Cl}(K) \to \bigoplus_e e\operatorname{Cl}(K)$, and show that the average size of this kernel is infinite when $p^2\mid |\Gamma|$.</div>

		The question of integer complexity asks about the minimal number of $1$'s that are needed to express a positive integer using only addition and multiplication (and parentheses). In this paper, we propose the notion of $l$-complexity of multiples of $l$, which specializes to integer complexity when $l=1$, prove several elementary results on $2$-complexity of even positive integers, and raise some interesting questions on $2$-complexity and in general $l$-complexity.</div>

		Let $(G,+)$ be an Abelian group. Given $h\in \mathbb{Z}^+$, a non-empty subset $A$ of $G$ is called an $S_h$-set if all the sums of $h$ distinct elements of $A$ are different. We extend the concept of $S_h$-set to a more general context in the context of finite vectorial spaces over finite fields. More precisely, a $\emptyset \neq A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^r$ is called an $S_h$-linear set if all the linear combinations of $h$ elements of $A$ are different. We establish a correspondence between $q$-ary linear codes and $S_h$-linear sets. This connection allow us to find lower bounds for the maximum size of $S_h$-sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^r$.</div>

		Finding explicit examples of sequences $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with Poissonian pair correlations (PPC) turns out to be a difficult problem. Therefore, this property is often studied in a random setting. While it is known that i.i.d. sequences of uniformly distributed random variables generically have Poissonian pair correlations, the case of dependent random variables has not been addressed in the literature yet. The present paper is the first contribution dealing with the dependent setting. More specifically, sequences of jittered samples and random walks on the torus are investigated. We show here that for the former class, the PPC property depends on how the finite sample is extended to an infinite sequence. Moreover, we prove that the random walk on the torus generically has PPC.</div>

		Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis and a pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Dirichlet $L$-functions, we establish the truth of a conjecture of Montgomery (in its corrected form stated by Friedlander and Granville) on the magnitude of the error term in the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions. As a consequence, we obtain that, under the same assumptions, the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture holds true.</div>

		The elements of a finite field of prime order canonically correspond to the integers in an interval. This induces an ordering on the elements of the field. Using this ordering, Kiss and Somlai recently proved interesting properties of the set of points below the diagonal line. In this paper, we investigate the set of points lying below a parabola. We prove that in some sense, this set of points looks the same from all but two directions, despite having only one non-trivial automorphism. In addition, we study the sizes of these sets, and their intersection numbers with respect to lines.</div>

		Let $\mathcal{K}=\mathbb{F}_q((x^{-1}))$. Analogous to orthogonality in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a well-studied notion of ultrametric orthogonality in $\mathcal{K}^n$. In this paper, we extend the work of \cite{AB24} about counting results related to orthogonality in $\mathcal{K}^n$. For example, we answer an open question from \cite{AB24} by bounding the size of the largest ``orthogonal sets'' in $\mathcal{K}^n$. Furthermore, we investigate analogues of Hadamard matrices over $\mathcal{K}$. Finally, we use orthogonality to compute the number of sublattices of $\mathbb{F}_q[x]^n$ with a certain geometric structure, as well as to determine the number of orthogonal bases for a sublattice in $\mathcal{K}^n$. The resulting formulas depend crucially on successive minima.</div>

The standardproof of this fact uses relations between elliptic integrals and the gamma function. In this article we generalize this result to relate areas of sectors of the squircle to arc lengths of segments of the lemniscate. We provide a geometric interpretation of this relation and an elementary proof of the relation, which only uses basic integral calculus.</div>

		In this article we shall survey some recent progress on the study of Ap\'ery-like sums which are multiple variable generalizations of the two sums Ap\'ery used in his famous proof of the irrationality of $\zeta(2)$ and $\zeta(3)$. We only allow the central binomial coefficients to appear in these infinite sums but they can appear either on the numerator or on the denominator. Special values of both types are closely related to the colored multiple zeta values and have played important roles in the calculations of the $\eps$-expansion of multiloop Feynman diagrams. We will summarize several different approaches to computing these sums and prove a few conjectural identities of Z.-W. Sun as corollaries along the way.</div>

		In this study, we investigate the lattice angle, which is defined as the angle between two vectors whose components are integers. We focus on the set of angles between a fixed integer vector and other integer vectors. For non-three-dimensional lattices, we proved that this set contains all lattice angles, irrespective of the fixed vector choice. In contrast, for the three-dimensional lattice, we proved that this set of angles cannot cover all lattice angles, for any fixed vector. Thus, only the three-dimensional lattice is an exception. We further provide the condition for a given three-dimensional integer vector to intersect another integer vector at a given angle, which involves a number-theoretic property of the squared norm of the given vector and the squared tangent of the given angle.</div>

It is shown that there is an explicit infinite set of cubefree integers $m$ such that the $3$-Selmer groups over $K$ of $E_{m^2 a}$ and $E_{m^4 a}$ both vanish.

		A field $K$ is quasi-classical $d$-local if there exist fields $K=k_d,\dots,k_0$ with $k_{i+1}$ Henselian admissible discretely valued with residue field $k_i$, and $k_0$ quasi-finite. We prove a duality theorem for the Galois cohomology of such $K$ with many coefficients, including finite coefficients of any order. Previously, such duality was only known in few cases : as a perfect pairing of finite groups for finite coefficients prime to $\mathrm{char} k_0$ in general, or for any finite coefficients when $k_1$ is $p$-adic ; or as a perfect pairing of locally compact Hausdorff groups for the $\mathrm{fppf}$ cohomology of finite group schemes when $K$ is local. With no obvious reasonable topology available, we abandon perfectness altogether and instead obtain nondegenerate pairings of abstract abelian groups. This is done with new diagram-chasing results for pairings of torsion groups, allowing a d\'evissage approach which reduces our results to the study of $K^M_r(K)/p\times H^{d+1-r}_p(K)\to\mathbb{Z}/p$ using results of Kato.</div>

We also give a general description of the character varieties of $2$-generated groups with a relation of the form $a^{n_1} b^{m_1} a^{n_2} b^{m_2} = 1$.</div>

		The modularity of an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb Q$ can be expressed either as an analytic statement that the $L$-function is the Mellin transform of a modular form, or as a geometric statement that $E$ is a quotient of a modular curve $X_0(N)$. For elliptic curves over number fields these notions diverge; a conjecture of Hamahata asserts that for every elliptic curve $E$ over a totally real number field there is a correspondence between a Hilbert modular variety and the product of the conjugates of $E$. In this paper we prove the conjecture by explicit computation for many cases where $E$ is defined over a real quadratic field and the geometric genus of the Hilbert modular variety is $1$.</div>

		In this paper we establish some new results similar to Lagrange's four-square theorem. For example, we prove that any integer $n>1$ can be written as $w(5w+1)/2+x(5x+1)/2+y(5y+1)/2+z(5z+1)/2$ with $w,x,y,z\in\mathbb Z$.
  Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $a>0$, $b>-a$ and $\gcd(a,b)=1$. When $2\nmid ab$, we show that any sufficiently large integer can be written as $$\frac{w(aw+b)}2+\frac{x(ax+b)}2+\frac{y(ay+b)}2+\frac{z(az+b)}2$$ with $w,x,y,z$ nonnegative integers. When $2\mid a$ and $2\nmid b$, we prove that any sufficiently large integer can be written as $$w(aw+b)+x(ax+b)+y(ay+b)+z(az+b)$$ with $w,x,y,z$ nonnegative integers.</div>

		For a fixed irrational $\theta>0$ with a prescribed irrationality measure function, we study the correlation $\int\limits_{1}^{X}\Delta\left(x\right)\Delta\left(\theta x\right)dx$, where $\Delta$ is the Dirichlet's Delta Function from the Divisor Problem. It is known that when $\theta$ have finite irrationality measure there's a decorrelation given in terms of its measure and a strong decorrelation is obtained at every positive irrational number, except, maybe, at the Liouville numbers. We prove that for the irrationals with a prescribed irrationality measure function $\psi$, a decorrelation can be obtained in terms of $\psi^{-1}$.</div>

		Batyrev and Tschinkel's example is a Fermat cubic surface bundle $X$ which is a Fano $5$-fold. It is the first example for which Manin's conjecture can never hold for a proper closed exceptional set. Recently, Lehmann, Sengupta, and Tanimoto proposed a conjectural geometric description of the exceptional set in Manin's conjecture and showed that it is always contained in a thin set. Over a field of characteristic $0$, we explicitly construct finitely many thin maps such that any thin map $f:Y\rightarrow X$ with equal or larger $a$- and $b$-values in lexicographical order factors rationally through one of them. In particular, this defines a thin set which coincides with Lehmann-Sengupta-Tanimoto's conjectural exceptional set.</div>

		For an inner form $\mathrm{G}$ of a general linear group or classical group over a non-archimedean local field of odd residue characteristic, we decompose the category of smooth representations on $\mathbb{Z}[\mu_{p^{\infty}},1/p]$-modules by endo-parameter. We prove that parabolic induction preserves these decompositions, and hence that it preserves endo-parameters. Moreover, we show that the decomposition by endo-parameter is the $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}[1/p]$-block decomposition; and, for $\mathrm{R}$ an integral domain, introduce a graph whose connected components parameterize the $\mathrm{R}$-blocks, in particular including the cases $\mathrm{R}=\overline{\mathbb{Z}}_{\ell}$ and $\mathrm{R}=\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$ for $\ell\neq p$. From our description, we deduce that the $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_\ell}$-blocks and $\overline{\mathbb{F}_\ell}$-blocks of $\mathrm{G}$ are in natural bijection, as had long been expected. Our methods also apply to the trivial endo-parameter (i.e., the depth zero subcategory) of any connected reductive $p$-adic group, providing an alternative approach to results of Dat and Lanard in depth zero. Finally, under a technical assumption (known for inner forms of general linear groups) we reduce the $\mathrm{R}$-block decomposition of $\mathrm{G}$ to depth zero.</div>

		Yanchevski\u{i} had asked whether conic bundle surfaces over $\mathbf{P}^1_k$ are unirational when $k$ is a finite field. We give a partial answer to his question by showing that for quasi-finite fields $k$ (e.g. finite fields) a regular conic bundle $X$ over $\mathbf{P}^1_k$ is unirational if all non-split fibres lie over rational points. For large finite fields $k$, this beats a previous result of Mestre. Under the same assumption, we also prove that all rational points of $X$ are $R$-equivalent.</div>
