		Given a reductive group $G$ and a reductive subgroup $H$, both defined over a number field $F$, we introduce the notion of the $H$-distinguished automorphic spectrum of $G$ and analyze it for the pair $(\mathrm{U}_{2n},\mathrm{Sp}_{2n})$. We derived a formula for period integrals of pseudo-Eisenstein series of $\mathrm{U}_{2n}$ in analogy with the main result of Lapid and Offen in their work analyzing the pair $(\mathrm{Sp}_{4n},\mathrm{Sp}_{2n} \times \mathrm{Sp}_{2n})$. We give an upper bound of the distinguished spectrum with the formula. A non-trivial lower bound of the discrete distinguished spectrum is expected from the formula, given the previous work.</div>

Starichkova</div><br>
		In 1977, Lenstra provided a criterion for norm-Euclideanity of number fields and noted that this criterion becomes ineffective for number fields of large enough degrees under the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for the Dedekind zeta-functions. We provide an explicit version of this statement: the criterion becomes ineffective under GRH for all $n \geq 62238$. Moreover, in the unconditional case, we show that the criterion still cannot be used for large enough degrees under an assumption on the lower bounds for the Dedekind zeta functions on the right of $s = 1$. Such lower bounds connect to the bounds for the sphere packings.</div>

		The cotangent zeta function is a very interesting object, which is related to partial zeta functions and Hecke $L$-functions of real quadratic fields. Its special values at odd integers greater than 1 are explicitly evaluated by Berndt in the real quadratic unit case. Later Arakawa generalized the formula to the arbitrary real quadratic number case. The purpose of this article is to give a novel and surprisingly simple proof of the Berndt--Arakawa formula. Namely we prove a certain asymptotic identity for two finite cotangent Dirichlet series, from which we deduce the Berndt--Arakawa formula immediately. The authors believe that the method employed here of evaluating special values of infinite Dirichlet series from an asymptotic identity for its finite partial sum is of interest in its own right.</div>

		Akhunzhanov and Shatskov defined the Dirichlet spectrum, corresponding to $m \times n$ matrices and to norms on $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$. In case $(m,n) = (2,1)$ and using the Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{R}^2$, they showed that the spectrum is an interval. We generalize this result to arbitrary $(m,n) \neq (1,1)$ and arbitrary norms, improving previous works from recent years. We also define some related spectra and show that they too are intervals. Our argument is a modification of an argument of Khintchine from 1926.</div>

		Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field with $q$ elements. For $a,b,c,d,e,f \in \mathbb{F}_q^{\times}$, denote by $C_{a,b,c,d,e,f}$ the family of algebraic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q$ given by the affine equation \begin{align*} C_{a,b,c,d,e,f}:ay^2+bx^2+cxy=d+ex^2y^2+fx^3y. \end{align*} The family of generalized twisted Edwards curves is a subfamily of $C_{a,b,c,d,e,f}$. Let $\#C_{a,b,c,d,e,f}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ denote the number of points on $C_{a,b,c,d,e,f}$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. In this article, we find certain expressions for $\#C_{a,b,c,d,e,f}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ when $af=ce$. If $c^2-4ab\neq 0$, we express $\#C_{a,b,c,d,e,f}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ in terms of a $p$-adic hypergeometric function $\mathbb{G}(x)$ whose values are explicitly known for all $x\in \mathbb{F}_q$. Next, if $c^2-4ab=0$, we express $\#C_{a,b,c,d,e,f}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ in terms of another $p$-adic hypergeometric function and then relate it to the traces of Frobenius endomorphisms of a family of elliptic curves. Furthermore, using the known values of the hypergeometric functions, we deduce some nice formulas for $\#C_{a,b,c,d,e,f}(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</div>

		We compute the joint distribution of singular numbers for all principal corners of a Hermitian (resp. alternating) matrix with additive Haar distribution over a non-archimedean local field, the non-archimedean analogue of the GUE (resp. aGUE) corners process. In the alternating case we find that it is a Hall-Littlewood process, explaining -- and recovering as a corollary -- results of Fulman-Kaplan. In the Hermitian case we obtain a `marginal distribution' of a formal Hall-Littlewood process with both positive and negative transition `probabilities'. The proofs relate natural random matrix operations to structural results of Hironaka and Hironaka-Sato on modules over the spherical Hecke algebra, yielding other probabilistic statements of independent interest along the way.</div>

		We introduce a theory of motivic cohomology for quasi-compact quasi-separated schemes, which generalises the construction of Elmanto--Morrow in the case of schemes over a field. Our construction is non-$\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant in general, but it uses the classical $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant motivic cohomology of smooth $\mathbb{Z}$-schemes as an input. The main new input of our construction is a global filtration on topological cyclic homology, whose graded pieces provide an integral refinement of derived de Rham cohomology and Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze's syntomic cohomology. Our theory satisfies various expected properties of motivic cohomology, including a relation to non-connective algebraic $K$-theory via an Atiyah--Hirzebruch spectral sequence, the projective bundle formula, and pro cdh descent.</div>

The second is to provide complete proofs of those of his main results and identities which are strictly useful in the context of (non-colored) multiple zeta values.

We describe their lattices, their groups $H^1$ and $H_1$, their tensor products, the duality functor and the duality theorem, endomorphisms of Drinfeld modules in finite characteristic, and a type of their L-functions. Further, we introduce the notion of affine equations, $T$-divisible $\Bbb F_q[[T]]$-modules, holonomic sequences in the functional field case, and some other notions (to be continued). Many examples of explicit calculations are given, some elementary research problems are stated.</div>

We show that for each $b \in B(G)$, the strongly regular locus of the inertia stack of $\operatorname{Bun}_G^b$ is open in the inertia stack of $\operatorname{Bun}_G$. As a consequence, we extend the computation of Hansen--Kaletha--Weinstein of trace distributions of the cohomology of local shtuka spaces $\mathrm{Sht}_{G,b,\mu}$ to non-basic $b$. If $b$ is closed in $B(G,\mu)$, or $b$ is basic and has only one specialization in $B(G,\mu)$, then we compute the trace distribution of the entire strongly regular locus.

		Let $k$ be a field, $T$ be an algebraic $k$-torus, $X$ be a smooth $k$-compactification of $T$ and ${\rm Pic}\,\overline{X}$ be the Picard group of $\overline{X}=X\times_k\overline{k}$ where $\overline{k}$ is a fixed separable closure of $k$. Hoshi, Kanai and Yamasaki [HKY22], [HKY23] determined $H^1(k,{\rm Pic}\, \overline{X})$ for norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ and gave a necessary and sufficient condition for the Hasse norm principle for extensions $K/k$ of number fields with $[K:k]\leq 15$. In this paper, we treat the case where $[K:k]=16$. Among $1954$ transitive subgroups $G=16Tm\leq S_{16}$ $(1\leq m\leq 1954)$ up to conjugacy, we determine $1101$ (resp. $774$, $31$, $37$, $1$, $1$, $9$) cases with $H^1(k,{\rm Pic}\, \overline{X})=0$ (resp. $Z/2Z$, $(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 2}$, $(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 3}$, $(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 4}$, $(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 6}$, $Z/4Z$) where $G$ is the Galois group of the Galois closure $L/k$ of $K/k$. We see that $H^1(k,{\rm Pic}\, \overline{X})=0$ implies that the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. In particular, among $22$ primitive $G=16Tm$ cases, i.e. $H\leq G=16Tm$ is maximal with $[G:H]=16$, we determine exactly $6$ cases $(m=178, 708, 1080, 1329, 1654, 1753)$ with $H^1(k,{\rm Pic}\, \overline{X})\neq 0$ $($$(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 2}$, $Z/2Z$, $(Z/2Z)^{\oplus 2}$, $Z/2Z$, $Z/2Z$, $Z/2Z$). Moreover, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the Hasse norm principle for $K/k$ with $[K:k]=16$ for $22$ primitive $G=16Tm$ cases. As a consequence of the $22$ primitive $G$ cases, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=1$, $1/2$, $1/4$ of $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ over a number field $k$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=1/|Sha(T)|$ where $Sha(T)$ is the Shafarevich-Tate group of $T$.</div>

Using this result, without assuming the finiteness of the Tate--Shafarevich group, we prove that the ratio $\frac{\#\Sha(E/\Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{D}))[4]}{\#\Sha(E_D/\Bbb{Q})[2]}$ can grow arbitrarily large, where $E_D$ denotes the quadratic twist of $E$ by $D$. For elliptic curves of the form $E : y^2 = x^3 + px$ with $p$ an odd prime, assuming the finiteness of the relevant Tate--Shafarevich groups, we prove two results: first, that $\Sha(E_D/\Bbb{Q})[2] = 0$ for infinitely many square-free integers $D$, and second, that $\#\Sha(E/\Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{D}))[2] \leq 4$ for infinitely many imaginary quadratic fields $\Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$, although $\Sha(E/\Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{D}))[2]$ cannot be made trivial in general.</div>

		Finding explicit examples of sequences $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with Poissonian pair correlations (PPC) turns out to be a difficult problem. Therefore, this property is often studied in a random setting. While it is known that i.i.d. sequences of uniformly distributed random variables generically have Poissonian pair correlations, the case of dependent random variables has not been addressed in the literature yet. The present paper is the first contribution dealing with the dependent setting. More specifically, sequences of jittered samples and random walks on the torus are investigated. We show here that for the former class, the PPC property depends on how the finite sample is extended to an infinite sequence. Moreover, we prove that, under some mild assumptions, the random walk on the torus generically has PPC.</div>

		In this paper, for any Shimura datum $(G,\mathcal{D})$ satisfying reasonable conditions so that many interesting cases satisfy, we prove some finiteness theorems for any graded vector space consisting of automorphic forms on $\mathcal{D}$ of some weights over the graded ring of automorphic forms on $X$ with positive parallel weights. We also discuss the integral base ring which we can work on. To realize automorphic forms as global sections on some coherent sheaves on the minimal compactification, we use the notion of reflexive sheaves and higher Koecher principle due to Kai-Wen Lan. Further, we give a more finer version of finiteness results for Siegel modular forms by using only the results of Chai-Faltings.</div>

		Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic different from $2$ and $G$ be either an odd special orthogonal group ${\rm SO}_{2r+1}(F)$ or a symplectic group ${\rm Sp}_{2r}(F)$. In this paper, we establish the local converse theorem for $G$. Namely, for given two irreducible admissible generic representations of $G$, if they have the same local gamma factors twisted by irreducible supercuspidal representations of ${\rm GL}_n(F)$ for all $1 \leq n \leq r$ with the same additive character, these representations are isomorphic. Using the theory of Cogdell, Shahidi, and Tsai on partial Bessel functions and the classification of irreducible generic representations, we break the barrier on the rank of twists $1 \leq n \leq 2r-1$ in the work of Jiang and Soudry, and extend the result of Q. Zhang, which was achieved for all supercuspidal representations in characteristic $0$.</div>

		For a finite multiset $A$ of an abelian group $G$, let $\text{FS}(A)$ denote the multiset of the $2^{|A|}$ subset sums of $A$. It is natural to ask to what extent $A$ can be reconstructed from $\text{FS}(A)$. We fully solve this problem for $2$-torsion-free groups $G$ by giving characterizations, both algebraic and combinatorial, of the fibers of $\text{FS}$. Equivalently, we characterize all pairs of multisets $A,B$ with $\text{FS}(A)=\text{FS}(B)$. Our results build on recent work of Ciprietti and the first author.</div>

		We study the geometry and arithmetic of the curves $C \colon y^3 = x^4 + ax^2 + b$ and their associated Prym abelian surfaces $P$. We prove a Torelli theorem in this context and give a geometric proof of the fact that $P$ has quaternionic multiplication (QM) by the quaternion order of discriminant $6$. This allows us to describe the Galois action on the geometric endomorphism algebra of $P$. As an application, we classify the torsion subgroups of the Mordell-Weil groups $P(\mathbb{Q})$, as both abelian groups and $\text{End}(P)$-modules.</div>
