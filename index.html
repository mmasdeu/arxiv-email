		In this article, we study the density conjecture of Katz and Sarnak for $L$-functions of ad\'elic Hilbert modular forms and their convolutions. In particular, under the generalised Riemann hypothesis, we establish several instances supporting the conjecture and extending the works of Iwaniec-Luo-Sarnak and many others. For applications, we obtain an upper bound for the average order of $L$-functions of Hilbert modular forms at $s=\frac{1}{2}$ as well as a positive proportion of non-vanishing of certain Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions.</div>

		Let $\nu_y(n)$ denote the number of distinct prime factors of $n$ that are
  $<y$. For $k$ a positive integer, and for $k+2\leq y\leq x$, let $S_{-k}(x,y)$ denote the sum \begin{eqnarray*} S_{-k}(x,y):=\sum_{n\leq x}(-k)^{\nu_y(n)}. \end{eqnarray*} In this paper, we describe our recent results on the asymptotic behavior of $S_{-k}(x,y)$ for $k+2\leq y\leq x$, and $x$ sufficiently large. There is a crucial difference in the asymptotic behavior of $S_{-k}(x,y)$ when $k+1$ is a prime and $k+1$ is composite, and this makes the problem particularly interesting. The results are derived utilizing a combination of the Buchstab-de Bruijn recurrence, the Perron contour integral method, and certain difference-differential equations. We present a summary of our results against the background of earlier work of the first author on sums of the M\"{o}bius function over integers with restricted prime factors and on a multiplicative generalization of the sieve.</div>

		In this short note we report on a coincidence of two mathematical quantities that, at first glance, have little to do with each other. On the one hand, there are the Lebesgue constants of the Walsh function system that play an important role in approximation theory, and on the other hand there is the star discrepancy of the van der Corput sequence that plays a prominent role in uniform distribution theory. Over the decades, these two quantities have been examined in great detail independently of each other and important results have been proven. Work in these areas has been carried out independently, but as we show here, they actually coincide. Interestingly, many theorems have been discovered in both areas independently, but some results have only been known in one area but not in the other.</div>

		In a remarkable article Ribet showed how to attach rational $2$-dimensional representations to elliptic ${\mathbb Q}$-curves. An abelian variety $A$ is a (weak) $K$-variety if it is isogenous to all of its $\text{Gal}_K$-conjugates. In this article we study the problem of attaching an absolutely irreducible $\ell$-adic representation of $\text{Gal}_K$ to an abelian $K$-variety, which sometimes has smaller dimension than expected. When possible, we also construct a Galois-equivariant pairing, which restricts the image of this representation. As an application of our construction, we prove modularity of abelian surfaces over ${\mathbb Q}$ with potential quaternionic multiplication.</div>

		We revisit certain one-parameter families of affine covers arising naturally from Euler's integral representation of hypergeometric functions. We introduce a partial compactification of this family.

		Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbf{Q}_p$ and let $\mathcal{G}_K = \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}_p}/K)$. Fontaine has constructed a useful classification of $p$-adic representations of $\mathcal{G}_K$ in terms of cyclotomic $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules. Lately, interest has risen around a generalization of the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules, replacing the cyclotomic extension with an arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension. Computations from Berger suggest that locally analytic vectors should provide such a generalization for any arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extension, and this has been conjectured by Kedlaya.
  In this paper, we focus on the case of $\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions, using recent work of Berger-Rozensztajn and Porat on an integral version of locally analytic vectors, and prove that Kedlaya's conjecture does not hold for anticyclotomic extensions. This also provide an example of an extension for which there is no overconvergent lift of its field of norms and for which there exist nontrivial higher locally analytic vectors</div>

		We consider three isogeny invariants of abelian varieties over finite fields: the Galois group, Newton polygon, and the angle rank. Motivated by work of Dupuy, Kedlaya, and Zureick-Brown, we define a new invariant called the weighted permutation representation which encompasses all three of these invariants and use it to study the subtle relationships between them. We use this permutation representation to classify the triples of invariants that occur for abelian surfaces and simple abelian threefolds.</div>

		In this article, we study $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of number rings by considering them as commutative unital $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras. We begin by characterizing all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations and inner $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the ring of algebraic integers of a quadratic number field. Then we characterize all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the ring of algebraic integers $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ of a $p^{\text{th}}$-cyclotomic number field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ ($p$ odd rational prime and $\zeta$ a primitive $p^{\text{th}}$-root of unity). We also conjecture (using SAGE and MATLAB) an \enquote{if and only if} condition for a $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation $D$ on $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ to be inner. We further characterize all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations and inner $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the bi-quadratic number ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{m}, \sqrt{n}]$ ($m$, $n$ distinct square-free rational integers). In each of the above cases, we also determine the rank and an explicit basis of the derivation algebra consisting of all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the number ring.</div>

		In a recent article, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied sets of recurrence for actions of the multiplicative semigroup $(\mathbb{N}, \times)$ and provided some sufficient conditions for sets of the form $S=\{(an+b)/(cn+d) \colon n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ to be sets of recurrence for such actions. A necessary condition for $S$ to be a set of multiplicative recurrence is that for every completely multiplicative function $f$ taking values on the unit circle, we have that $\liminf_{n \to \infty} |f(an+b)-f(cn+d)|=0.$ In this article, we fully characterize the integer quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ which satisfy the latter property. Our result generalizes a result of Klurman and Mangerel concerning the pair $(n,n+1)$, as well as some results of Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun.

		Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unity and $B = A[\theta]$ be an integral extension of $A$. Assume that $B$ is an integral domain with quotient field $\mathbb{K}$ and $\mathbb{E}$ is the minimal splitting field of $\theta$ over $\mathbb{K}$. Suppose $\sigma, \tau: B \rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ are two different ring homomorphisms that fix $A$ element-wise. In this article, we classify all $A$-linear maps $D: B \rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ which are $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations. Consequently, we classify all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations in certain field extensions, algebraic number fields, and their ring of algebraic integers. For the ring of algebraic integers, $O_{\mathbb{K}} = \mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$ of the cyclotomic number field $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ ($\zeta$ an $n^{\text{th}}$ primitive root of unity), and a pair $(\sigma, \tau)$ of two different $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra endomorphisms of $O_{\mathbb{K}}$, we conjecture a necessary and sufficient condition for a $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation $D:O_{\mathbb{K}} \rightarrow O_{\mathbb{K}}$ to be inner. This is done for two different forms of $n$: (i) $n = 2^{r}p$ ($r \in \mathbb{N}$ and $p$ an odd rational prime), and (ii) $n=p^{k}$ ($k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $p$ any rational prime). We also conjecture the existence and non-existence of non-zero outer derivations for the above two forms of $n$, thus answering the twisted derivation problem in $O_{\mathbb{K}}$.</div>

		We construct a theory of (etale) Berkovich motives. This is closely related to Ayoub's theory of rigid-analytic motives, but works uniformly in the archimedean and nonarchimedean setting. We aim for a self-contained treatment, not relying on previous work on algebraic or analytic motives. Applying the theory to discrete fields, one still recovers the etale version of Voevodsky's theory. Two notable features of our setting which do not hold in other settings are that over any base, the cancellation theorem holds true, and under only minor assumptions on the base, the stable $\infty$-category of motivic sheaves is rigid dualizable.</div>

		In this paper, we try to extend Berger's and Colmez's point of view, using locally analytic vectors in order to generalize classical cyclotomic theory, in higher rings of periods. We also explain how the formalism of locally analytic vectors recovers the ring $\mathbf{B}_{Sen}$ of Colmez, and extends to Sen theory in the de Rham case, and to classical $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules theory. We explain what happens when we try to generalize constructions of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules to arbitrary infinitely ramified $p$-adic Lie extensions, and provide a conjecture on the structure of the locally analytic vectors in the corresponding rings. We also highlight the fact that the situation should be very different, depending on wether the $p$-adic Lie extension ``contains a cyclotomic extension'' or not. Finally, we explain how some of these constructions may be related to the construction of a ring of trianguline periods.</div>

Combining results of Barrera Salazar--Williams, we show a non-vanishing result of this $p$-adic adjoint $L$-function at certain points.

Our proof is based on the Borodin product formula, the Corteel-Welsh recursion for the cylindric partitions, a $q$-version of Sister Celine's technique and a generalization of Andrews' partition ideals by finite automata due to Takigiku and the author.</div>

		A parametrised diffusion operator on the regular domain $\Omega$ of a $p$-adic Schottky group is constructed. It is defined as an integral operator on the complex-valued functions on $\Omega$ which are invariant under the Schottky group $\Gamma$, where integration is against the measure defined by an invariant regular differential 1-form $\omega$. It is proven that the space of Schottky invariant $L^2$-functions on $\Omega$ outside the zeros of $\omega$ has an orthonormal basis consiting of $\Gamma$-invariant extensions of Kozyrev wavelets which are eigenfunctions of the operator. The eigenvalues are calculated, and it is shown that the heat equation for this operator provides a unique solution for its Cauchy problem with Schottky-invariant continuous initial conditions supportes outside the zero set of $\omega$, and gives rise to a strong Markov process on the corresponding orbit space for the Schottky group whose paths are c\`adl\`ag.</div>

		The Cayley sum graph $\Gamma_A$ of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$ is defined to have vertex set $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and an edge between two distinct vertices $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ if $x + y \in A$. Green and Morris proved that if the set $A$ is a $p$-random subset of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ with $p = 1/2$, then the independence number of $\Gamma_A$ is asymptotically equal to $\alpha(G(n, 1/2))$ with high probability. Our main theorem is the first extension of their result to $p = o(1)$: we show that, with high probability, $$\alpha(\Gamma_A) = (1 + o(1)) \alpha(G(n, p))$$ as long as $p \ge (\log n)^{-1/80}$.
  One of the tools in our proof is a geometric-flavoured theorem that generalises Fre\u{i}man's lemma, the classical lower bound on the size of high dimensional sumsets. We also give a short proof of this result up to a constant factor; this version yields a much simpler proof of our main theorem at the expense of a worse constant.</div>

		It is well known that there is a somewhat mysterious relation between the area of the quartic Fermat curve $x^4+y^4=1$, aka squircle, and the arc length of the lemniscate $(x^2+y^2)^2=x^2-y^2$. The standardproof of this fact uses relations between elliptic integrals and the gamma function. In this article we generalize this result to relate areas of sectors of the squircle to arc lengths of segments of the lemniscate. We provide a geometric interpretation of this relation and an elementary proof of the relation, which only uses basic integral calculus. We also discuss an alternate version of this kind of relation, which is implicit in a calculation of Siegel.</div>

		Given an animated ring $S$, we define a filtration on its absolute prismatic cohomology $\mathcal{N}_r^{\geq i} \mathbb{\Delta}_S$, which we call the $r$-Nygaard filtration and study some of its main properties using a mixture of algebraic and homotopy theoretic techniques. This filtration is obtained by suitably gluing $r$-copies of the usual Nygaard filtration and corresponds to the $\xi_r$-adic filtration on $\mathbb{A}_{\mathrm{inf}}$, in the case that $S$ is a perfectoid ring.
  Using this, we study the motivic filtration of topological restriction homology $\mathrm{TR}^r (S;\mathbb{Z}_p)$ and of its $S^1$-homotopy fixed points. We also pursue connections with the theory of topological cyclic homology. Finally we discuss connections with the de Rham--Witt complex, towards a prismatic - de Rham--Witt comparison theorem.</div>

		We develop the fibration method to produce rational (or integral) points on the total space with few multiple fibers over the projective line over number fields. As its application, we prove strong approximation without off any place and arithmetic purity for two classes of open rationally connected varieties: the smooth locus of singular del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\geq 4$ and the smooth locus of complete normal toric varieties. We also study strong approximation for the intersection of two affine quadrics. As its application, we get an unconditional result of fibration method for rank 4.</div>
