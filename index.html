		Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field with $q=p^s$ elements, where $p$ is an odd prime and $s$ a positive integer. In this paper, we define the function $f(X)=(cX^q+aX)(X^{q}-X)^{n-1}$, for $a,c\in\mathbb{F}_q$ and $n\geq 1$. We study the dynamics of the function $f(X)$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, determining cycle lengths and number of cycles. We also show that all trees attached to cyclic elements are isomorphic, with the exception of the tree hanging from zero. We also present the general shape of such hanging trees, which concludes the complete description of the functional graph of $f(X)$.<br>

<br>	<div id="authors">Daniel E. Martin</div><br>
		For a prime number $\ell$ and an extension of number fields $K/F$, we prove new lower bounds on the $\ell$-rank of the ideal class group of $K$ based on prime ramification in $K/F$. Unlike related results from the literature, our bound is supported on prime ideals in $F$ over which at least one (rather than each) prime in $K$ has ramification index divisible by $\ell$. This bound holds with a proviso on the Galois group of the normal closure of $K/F$, which is satisfied by towers of Galois extensions, intermediate fields in nilpotent extensions, and intermediate fields in dihedral extensions of degree $8n$, to name a few. We also use our lower bound to prove a new density result on number fields with infinite class field towers.<br>

		In this survey, we outline the role of G-functions in arithmetic geometry, notably their link with Picard-Fuchs differential equations and periods. We explain how polynomial relations between special values of G-functions arising from a pencil of algebraic varieties may occur at a parameter where the fiber has more ``motivic" symmetries; and how Bombieri's principle of global relations can be used to control the height of such parameters (which was also one of the origins of the Andr\'e-Oort conjecture). At the end, we sketch the recent revival of the G-function method in the context of unlikely intersections and the Zilber-Pink conjecture.<br>

		Ap\'ery's remarkable discovery of rapidly converging continued fractions with small coefficients for $\zeta(2)$ and $\zeta(3)$ has led to a flurry of important activity in an incredible variety of different directions.

<br>	<div id="authors">Adrian Beker</div><br>
		A $k$-configuration is a collection of $k$ distinct integers $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ together with their pairwise arithmetic means $\frac{x_i+x_j}{2}$ for $1 \leq i < j \leq k$. Building on recent work of Filmus, Hatami, Hosseini and Kelman on binary systems of linear forms and of Kelley and Meka on Roth's theorem on arithmetic progressions, we show that, for $N \geq \exp((k\log(2/\alpha))^{O(1)})$, any subset $A \subseteq [N]$ of density at least $\alpha$ contains a $k$-configuration. This improves on the previously best known bound $N \geq \exp((2/\alpha)^{O(k^2)})$, due to Shao. As a consequence, it follows that any finite non-empty set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ contains a subset $B \subseteq A$ of size at least $(\log|A|)^{1+\Omega(1)}$ such that $b_1+b_2 \not\in A$ for any distinct $b_1,b_2 \in B$. This provides a new proof of a lower bound for the Erd\H{o}s--Moser sum-free set problem of the same shape as the best known bound, established by Sanders.<br>

<br>	<div id="authors">Zhan Shi, Lin Weng</div><br>
		As a continuation of our earlier paper, in this one, we offer a new approach to murmurations and Sato-Tate laws for higher rank zetas of elliptic curves. Our approach here does not depend on the Riemann hypothesis for the so-called a-invariant in rank n>2 even for the Sato-Tate law, rather, on a much refined structure. Such a refined structure was already observed by Zagier and the senior author when the rank n Riemann hypothesis was established. Namely, instead of the rank n Riemann hypothesis bounds is based, we use much stronger asymptotic bounds instead. Nevertheless, rank n Sato-Tate law can be established and rank n murmuration can be formulated equally well, similar to the corresponding structures in the abelian framework for Artin zetas of elliptic curves.<br>

		We construct a mod $\ell$ congruence between a Klingen Eisenstein series (associated to a classical newform $\phi$ of weight $k$) and a Siegel cusp form $f$ with irreducible Galois representation. We use this congruence to show non-vanishing of the Bloch-Kato Selmer group $H^1_f(\mathbf{Q}, \textrm{ad}^0\rho_{\phi}(2-k)\otimes \mathbf{Q}_{\ell}/\mathbf{Z}_{\ell})$ under certain assumptions and provide an example. We then prove an $R=dvr$ theorem for the Fontaine-Laffaille universal deformation ring of $\overline{\rho}_f$ under some assumptions, in particular, that the residual Selmer group $H^1_f(\mathbf{Q}, \textrm{ad}^0\overline{\rho}_{\phi}(k-2))$ is cyclic. For this we prove a result about extensions of Fontaine-Laffaille modules. We end by formulating conditions for when $H^1_f(\mathbf{Q}, \textrm{ad}^0\overline{\rho}_{\phi}(k-2))$ is non-cyclic and the Eisenstein ideal is non-principal.<br>

		Letting $\delta_1(n,m)$ be the density of the set of integers with exactly one divisor in $(n,m)$, Erd\H{o}s wondered if $\delta_1(n,m)$ is unimodular for fixed $n$.
  We prove this is false in general, as the sequence $(\delta_1(n,m))$ has superpolynomially many local extrema. However, we confirm unimodality in the single case for which it occurs; $n = 1$.
  We also solve the question on unimodality of the density of integers whose $k^{th}$ prime is $p$.<br>

		This paper explores the interplay between holonomy, Ihara zeta functions, and cohomological structures within the framework of ratified F-completions of foliated manifolds. We develop a novel formalism for the Gamma-set, a topological multigraph that captures intersection points of foliations with stratified boundaries, and use it to define an Ihara zeta function that encodes the manifold's symmetries. By investigating the holonomy group of spinor fields in relation to the Delta-actions on the Gamma-set, we conjecture a duality between holonomy fixed points and the poles of the Ihara zeta function, extending to twisted cohomology classes. We further analyze how the twist map T impacts cohomology within stratified spaces, highlighting the role of vector bundles and the twisted cochain complex. Applications of our framework to spectral graph theory and tiling in R^n demonstrate the power of holonomy-zeta duality in geometrically rich foliated structures.<br>

<br>	<div id="authors">Brian Lawrence, Will Sawin</div><br>
		Faltings proved that there are finitely many abelian varieties of genus $g$ over a number field $K$, with good reduction outside a finite set of primes $S$. Fixing one of these abelian varieties $A$, we prove that there are finitely many smooth hypersurfaces in $A$, with good reduction outside $S$, representing a given ample class in the N\'eron-Severi group of $A$, up to translation, as long as the dimension of $A$ is at least $4$. Our approach builds on the approach of arXiv:1807.02721 which studies $p$-adic variations of Hodge structure to turn finiteness results for $p$-adic Galois representations into geometric finiteness statements. A key new ingredient is an approach to proving big monodromy for the variations of Hodge structure arising from the middle cohomology of these hypersurfaces using the Tannakian theory of sheaf convolution on abelian varieties.<br>

<br>	<div id="authors">Tapas Chatterjee, Sagar Mandal, Sourav Mandal</div><br>
		Solitary numbers are shrouded with mystery. A folklore conjecture assert that 10 is a solitary number i.e. it has no friends. In this article, we establish that if $N$ is a friend of $10$ then it must be odd square with at least seven distinct prime factors, with $5$ being the least one. Moreover there exists a prime factor $p$ of $N$ such that $2a+1\equiv 0 \pmod f$ and $5^{f}\equiv 1 \pmod p$ where $f$ is the smallest odd positive integer greater than $1$ and less than or equal to $\min\{ 2a+1,p-1\}$, provided $5^{2a}\mid \mid N$. Further, there exist prime factors $p$ and $q$ (not necessarily distinct) of $N$ such that $p\equiv1 \pmod {10}$ and $q\equiv 1\pmod 6$. Besides, we prove that if a Fermat prime $F_k$ divides $N$ then $N$ must have a prime factor congruent to $1$ modulo $2F_k$. Also, if we consider the form of $N$ as $N=5^{2a}m^2$ then $m$ is non square-free. Furthermore, we show that $\Omega(N)\geq 2\omega(N)+6a-4$ and if $\Omega(m)\leq K$ then $N< 5\cdot 6^{(2^{K-2a+1}-1)^2}$ where $\Omega(n)$ and $\omega(n)$ denote the total number of prime factors and the number of distinct prime factors of the integer $n$ respectively.<br>

		Let $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and $s\geq k(\log k+3.20032)$. Let $\mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ be the set of $k$-th powers of nonnegative integers. Assume that $\psi$ is an increasing function tending to infinity with $\psi(x)=o(\log x)$ and satifying some regularity conditions. Then, there exists a subsequence $\mathfrak{X}_{k}=\mathfrak{X}_{k}(s)\subset\mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ for which the number of representations $R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k})$ of each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ as $$n=x_{1}^{k}+\ldots+x_{s}^{k}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x_{i}^{k}\in\mathfrak{X}_{k}$$ satisfies the asymptotic formula $$ R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k})\sim \mathfrak{S}(n)\psi(n)$$ for almost all natural numbers $n$, with $\mathfrak{S}(n)$ being the singular series associated to Waring's problem. If moreover $s\geq k(\log k+4.20032)$ the above conclusion holds for almost all $n\in [X,X+\log X]$ as $X\to\infty$.
  Let $T(k)$ be the least natural number for which it is known that all large integers are the sum of $T(k)$ $k$-th powers of natural numbers. We also show for $k\geq 14$ and every $s\geq T(k)$ the existence of a sequence $\mathfrak{X}_{k}'\subset \mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ satisfying $$R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k}')\asymp \log n$$ for every sufficiently large $n$. The latter conclusion sharpens a result of Wooley and addresses a question of Vu.<br>

		We make an application of ideas from partition theory to a problem in multiplicative number theory. We propose a deterministic model of prime number distribution, from first principles related to properties of integer partitions, that predicts the prime number theorem and suggests new conjectures regarding predictable variations in prime gaps. The model posits that, for $n\geq 2$, $$p_{n}\ =\ 1\ +\ 2\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\left\lceil \frac{d(j)}{2}\right\rceil\ +\ \varepsilon(n),$$
  where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime number, $d(k)$ is the divisor function, and $\varepsilon(k)\geq 0$ is an error that is negligible asymptotically; both the main term and error are enumerative functions in our conceptual model. We refine the error to give numerical estimates of $\pi(n)$ similar to those provided by the logarithmic integral, and much more accurate than $\operatorname{li}(n)$ up to $n=10{,}000$ where the estimate is almost exact. We also test a seemingly dubious prediction suggested by the model, that prime-indexed primes $p_2, p_3, p_5, p_7,$ etc., are more likely to be involved in twin prime pairs than are arbitrary primes; surprisingly, computations show prime-indexed primes are more likely to be twin primes up to at least $n=10{,}000{,}000{,}000$, with the bias diminishing but persistent as $n$ increases.<br>

		Number fields and their rings of integers, which generalize the rational numbers and the integers, are foundational objects in number theory. There are several computer algebra systems and databases concerned with the computational aspects of these. In particular, computing the ring of integers of a given number field is one of the main tasks of computational algebraic number theory. In this paper, we describe a formalization in Lean 4 for certifying such computations. In order to accomplish this, we developed several data types amenable to computation. Moreover, many other underlying mathematical concepts and results had to be formalized, most of which are also of independent interest. These include resultants and discriminants, as well as methods for proving irreducibility of univariate polynomials over finite fields and over the rational numbers. To illustrate the feasibility of our strategy, we formally verified entries from the $\textit{Number fields}$ section of the $\textit{L-functions and modular forms database}$ (LMFDB). These concern, for several number fields, the explicitly given $\textit{integral basis}$ of the ring of integers and the $\textit{discriminant}$. To accomplish this, we wrote SageMath code that computes the corresponding certificates and outputs a Lean proof of the statement to be verified.<br>

		We give a formula for the density of $0$ in the sequence of generalized Motzkin numbers, $M^{a, b}_n$, modulo a prime, $p$, in terms of the first $p$ generalized central trinomial coefficients $T^{a, b}_n\bmod p$ (with $n<p$). We apply our method to various other sequences to obtain similar formulas. We also prove that $T^{a, b}_{p-1-n}\equiv (b^2-4a^2)^{\frac{p-1}{2}-n}T^{a, b}_n\pmod p$ to obtain tight lower bounds for the density of $0$ in our sequences. This symmetry of the first $p$ central trinomial coefficients mod $p$ also appears in a couple of other applications, including the proof of a novel symmetry of the first $p-2$ Motzkin numbers that is of independent interest: $M^{a, b}_{p-3-n}\equiv (b^2-4a^2)^{\frac{p-3}{2}-n}M^{a, b}_n\pmod p$.<br>
