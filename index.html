<br>	<div id="authors">Ayla Gafni, Nicolas Robles</div><br>
		We introduce a general class $F_0$ of additive functions $f$ such that $f(p) = 1$ and prove a tight bound for exponential sums of the form $\sum_{n \le x} f(n) e(\alpha n)$ where $f \in F_0$ and $e(\theta) = \exp(2\pi i \theta)$. Both $\omega$, the number of distinct primes of $n$, and $\Omega$, the total number primes of $n$, are members of $F_0$. As an application of the exponential sum result, we use the Hardy-Littlewood circle method to find the asymptotics of the Goldbach-Vinogradov ternary problem associated to $\Omega$, namely we show the behavior of $r_\Omega(N) = \sum_{n_1+n_2+n_3=N}\Omega(n_1)\Omega(n_2)\Omega(n_3)$, as $N \to \infty$. Lastly, we end with a discussion of further applications of the main result.<br>

<br>	<div id="authors">Peiduo Wang</div><br>
		In this paper, we study coherent locally free (logarithmic-)$\nabla$-modules on relative $p$-adic polyannuli satisfying the Robba condition and prove several criteria for decomposition of such (logarithmic-)$\nabla$-modules. Firstly we prove the $p$-adic Fuchs theorem for absolute logarithmic $\nabla$-modules where the exponents have non-Liouville differences, which generalizes a result of Shiho. Secondly, we prove a generalized $p$-adic Fuchs theorem for relative $\nabla$-modules which are semi-constant on fibers. We also prove a generalized $p$-adic Fuchs theorem for absolute $\nabla$-modules, when the derivation on the base has some specific form. In the appendix, we prove the coincidence of two definitions of exponents due to Christol-Mebkhout and Dwork and prove that the set of exponents forms exactly one weak equivalence class.<br>

		The focus of this note is to formulate the algorithms and give the examples used by Fibonacci in Liber Abaci to expand any fraction into a sum of unit fractions. The description in Liber Abaci is all verbal and the examples are numbers which may lead to different algorithmic descriptions with the same input and results. An additional complication is that the manuscripts that exist are copies of an older manuscript and in the process new errors are introduced. Additional errors may also be introduced in the transcript and the translation. Fibonacci introduces seven categories each with several numerical examples. We give a precise description of the computational procedure using standard mathematical notation.<br>

		We study the probability with which an elliptic curve $E/k$, subject to some technical conditions, gains rank upon base extension to an $S_3$-cubic extension $K/k$ with quadratic resolvent field $F/k$, all three fields of which are subject to some mild technical conditions. To do so, we determine the distribution (under a non-standard ordering) of Selmer ranks of an auxiliary abelian variety associated to $E$ and $S_3$-cubic extensions $K/k$ following ideas of Klagsbrun, Mazur, and Rubin. One corollary of this distribution is that $E$ gains rank by at most one upon base extension to $K$ with probability at least $31.95\%$.<br>

The conditions are sharp up to constant factors in the unbalanced case, and the proof makes use of tools from discrete Fourier analysis and results in restriction/extension theory.<br>

<br>	<div id="authors">Rajula Srivastava, Krystal Taylor</div><br>
		In this note, we study a lattice point counting problem for spheres in Heisenberg groups, incorporating both the non-isotropic dilation structure and the non-commutative group law. More specifically, we establish an upper bound for the average number of lattice points in a $\delta$-neighborhood of a Kor\'anyi sphere of large radius, where the average considered is over Heisenberg group translations of the sphere. This is in contrast with previous works, which either count lattice points on dilates of a fixed sphere (see \cites{GNT, Gath2}) or consider averages over Euclidean translations of the sphere (see \cites{CT}). We observe that incorporating the Heisenberg group structure allows us to circumvent the degeneracy arising from the vanishing of the Gaussian curvature at the poles of the Kor\'anyi sphere. In fact, in lower dimensions (the first and second Heisenberg group), our method establishes an upper bound for this number which gives a logarithmic improvement over the bound implied by the previously known results. Even for the higher dimensional Heisenberg groups, we recover the bounds implied by the main result of \cite{GNT} using a completely different approach of generalized Radon transforms.
  Further, we obtain upper bounds for the average number of lattice points near more general spheres described with respect to radial, Heisenberg homogeneous norms as considered in \cite{GNT}.<br>

		We give an upper bound for the norm of the determinant of non-decomposable totally positive quadratic forms defined over the ring of integers of totally real number fields.

For $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}),\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}),\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{21})$, we classify up to equivalence all the classical, non-decomposable binary quadratic forms<br>

<br>	<div id="authors">Guo-Niu Han, Emmanuel Pedon</div><br>
		Fix $n$ a positive integer. Take the $n$-th metallic number $\phi_n=\frac{n+\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}$ (e.g. $\phi_1$ is the golden number) and let $\Phi_n(q)$ be its $q$-deformation in the sense of S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko. This is an algebraic continued fraction which admits an expansion into a Taylor series around $q=0$, with integral coefficients. By using the notion of Hankel continued fraction introduced by the first author in 2016 we determine explicitly the first $n+2$ sequences of shifted Hankel determinants of $\Phi_n$ and show that they satisfy the following properties:
  1) They are periodic and consist of $-1,0,1$ only.
  2) They satisfy a three-term Gale-Robinson recurrence, i.e. they form discrete integrable dynamical systems.
  3) They are all completely determined by the first sequence.
  This article thus validates a conjecture formulated by V. Ovsienko and the second author in a recent paper and establishes new connections between $q$-deformations of real numbers and sequences of Catalan or Motzkin numbers.<br>

<br>	<div id="authors">Evan Chen</div><br>
		As an analog to the Jacquet-Rallis fundamental lemma that appears in the relative trace formula approach to the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectures, the arithmetic fundamental lemma was proposed by Wei Zhang and used in an approach to the arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectures. The Jacquet-Rallis fundamental lemma was recently generalized by Spencer Leslie to a statement holding for the full spherical Hecke algebra. In the same spirit, Li, Rapoport, and Zhang have recently formulated a conjectural generalization of the arithmetic fundamental lemma to the full spherical Hecke algebra. This paper formulates another analogous conjecture for the semi-Lie version of the arithmetic fundamental lemma proposed by Yifeng Liu. Then this paper produces explicit formulas for particular cases of the weighted orbital integrals in the two conjectures mentioned above, and proves the first non-trivial case of the conjecture.<br>

<br>	<div id="authors">Josef Dick, Takashi Goda, Gerhard Larcher, Friedrich Pillichshammer, Kosuke Suzuki</div><br>
		The discrepancy of a point set quantifies how well the points are distributed, with low-discrepancy point sets demonstrating exceptional uniform distribution properties. Such sets are integral to quasi-Monte Carlo methods, which approximate integrals over the unit cube for integrands of bounded variation. In contrast, quasi-uniform point sets are characterized by optimal separation and covering radii, making them well-suited for applications such as radial basis function approximation. This paper explores the quasi-uniformity properties of quasi-Monte Carlo point sets constructed from lattices. Specifically, we analyze rank-1 lattice point sets, Fibonacci lattice point sets, Frolov point sets, and $(n \boldsymbol{\alpha})$-sequences, providing insights into their potential for use in applications that require both low-discrepancy and quasi-uniform distribution. As an example, we show that the $(n \boldsymbol{\alpha})$-sequence with $\alpha_j = 2^{j/(d+1)}$ for $j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, d\}$ is quasi-uniform and has low-discrepancy.<br>

		New expressions and bounds for Catalan's and Apery's constants, derived from the half hyperbolic secant distribution, are presented. These constants are obtained by using expressions for the Lorenz curve, the Gini and Theil indices, convolutions and a mixture of distributions, among other approaches. The new expressions are presented both in terms of integral (simple and double) representation and also as an interesting series representation. Some of these features are well known, while others are new. In addition, some integral representations of Euler's numbers are obtained.<br>

In this article, we give a different proof of one of their identities. The main step is to prove that a certain indefinite theta function involving spherical polynomials is actually a modular form.

		We establish that the singular numbers (arising from Cartan decomposition) and corners (emerging from Iwasawa decomposition) in split reductive groups over non-archimedean fields are fundamentally determined by Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Through applications of the Satake isomorphism, we extend Van Peski's results (arXiv:2011.09356, Theorem 1.3) to encompass arbitrary root systems. Leveraging this theoretical foundation, we further develop Shen's work (arXiv:2411.01104, Theorem 1.1) to demonstrate that both singular numbers and corners of such products exhibit minimal separation. This characterization enables the derivation of asymptotic properties for singular numbers in matrix products, particularly establishing the strong law of large numbers and central limit theorem for these quantities. Our results provide a unified framework connecting algebraic decomposition structures with probabilistic limit theorems in non-archimedean settings.<br>

		Recently, Amdeberhan et al. proved congruences for the number of hooks of fixed even length among the set of self-conjugate partitions of an integer $n$, therefore answering positively a conjecture raised by Ballantine et al.. In this paper, we show how these congruences can be immediately derived and generalized from an addition theorem for self-conjugate partitions proved by the second author. We also recall how the addition theorem proved before by Han and Ji can be used to derive similar congruences for the whole set of partitions, which are originally due to Bessenrodt, and Bacher and Manivel. Finally, we extend such congruences to the set of $z$-asymmetric partitions defined by Ayyer and Kumari, by proving an addition-multiplication theorem for these partitions. Among other things, this contains as special cases the congruences for the number of hook lengths for the self-conjugate and the so-called doubled distinct partitions.<br>

		Inspired by recent work of Aslanyan and Daw, we introduce the notion of $\Sigma$-orbits in the general framework of distinguished categories. In the setting of connected Shimura varieties, this concept contains many instances of (generalized) Hecke orbits from the literature. In the setting of semiabelian varieties, a $\Sigma$-orbit is a subgroup of finite rank. We show that our $\Sigma$-orbits have useful functorial properties and we use them to formulate two general statements of Mordell-Lang type (one of them implying the other one). We prove an analogue of a recent theorem of Aslanyan and Daw in this general setting, which we apply to deduce an unconditional result about unlikely intersections in a fibered power of the Legendre family. In an appendix, we prove an unconditional Zilber-Pink result for subvarieties of $\mathcal{A}_g$ that cannot be defined over the algebraic numbers.<br>

		Write $T(n)$ as the sum of the reciprocals of the primes which divide $n$. Write $H(n) = \prod_{p|n}p/(p-1)$ where the product is over the prime divisors of $n$. We prove new bounds for $T(n)$ and $H(n)$ in terms of the smallest prime factor of $n$, under the assumption that $n$ is an odd perfect number. Some of the results also apply under the weaker assumption that $n$ is odd and primitive non-deficient.<br>

		In this paper we extend the arithmetic intersection theory of adelic divisors on quasiprojective varieties developed by X. Yuan and S. W. Zhang to cover certain adelic arithmetic divisors that are not nef nor integrable. The key concept used in this extension is the relative finite energy introduced by T. Darvas, E. Di Nezza, and C. H. Lu. As an application, we prove that the line bundle of Siegel--Jacobi forms on the universal abelian variety endowed with its invariant hermitian metric is not integrable but we compute its arithmetic self-intersection number using the new extension. The techniques developed in this paper can be applied in many other situations like mixed Shimura varieties or the moduli space of stable marked curves.<br>

Helson conjectured that $\mathbb{E}|\sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)|=o(\sqrt{x})$ as $x \to \infty$, and this was solved in strong form by Harper.

		Let $(U_n)_{n\geq 0}$ be a non-degenerate linear recurrence sequence with order at least two defined over a function field and $\mathcal{O}_S^*$ be the set of $S$-units. In this paper, we use a result of Brownawell and Masser to prove effective results related to the Diophantine equations concerning linear recurrence sequences and $S$-units. In particular, we provide a finiteness result for the solutions of the Diophantine equation $U_{n_1} + \cdots + U_{n_r} \in \mathcal{O}_S^*$ in nonnegative integers $n_1, \ldots, n_r$. Furthermore, we study the finiteness result of the Diophantine equation $U_n+V_m+W_\ell = 0$ in $(n, m, \ell)\in \N^3$, where $U_n,V_m,W_\ell$ are simple linear recurrence sequences in the function field.<br>

		We give the stabilisation of local orbital integrals and the trace formula over a global field for $SL(2)$ with proofs valid in any characteristic. New features appear in characteristic 2. We obtain, via the stabilisation, an asymptotic expansion near the identity of local orbital integrals which is equivalent, up to a Fourier transform, to the standard germ expansion due to Shalika when the characteristic is not 2 but it is new in characteristic 2. Similarly the fine expansion of the unipotent contribution to the trace formula cannot be obtained using Arthur's techniques and a pre-stabilisation is necessary.<br>

		In this paper, by some arithmetic properties of the Pell sequence and some $p$-adic tools, we study certain cyclotomic matrices involving squares over finite fields. For example, let $1=s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_{(q-1)/2}$ be all the nonzero squares over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, where $q=p^f$ is an odd prime power with $q\ge7$. We prove that the matrix
  $$B_q((q-3)/2)=\left[\left(s_i+s_j\right)^{(q-3)/2}\right]_{2\le i,j\le (q-1)/2}$$
  is a singular matrix whenever $f\ge2$. Also, for the case $q=p$, we show that
  $$\det B_p((p-3)/2)=0\Leftrightarrow Q_p\equiv 2\pmod{p^2\mathbb{Z}},$$
  where $Q_p$ is the $p$-th term of the companion Pell sequence $\{Q_i\}_{i=0}^{\infty}$ defined by $Q_0=Q_1=2$ and $Q_{i+1}=2Q_i+Q_{i-1}$.<br>

		There has been considerable work around computing images of Galois representations coming from elliptic curves. This paper reports on an algorithm to determine the image of the mod-$3$ Galois representation associated to a principally polarized abelian surface over $\mathbb{Q}$. Conjugacy class distribution of subgroups of $\mathrm{GSp}(4,\mathbb{F}_3)$ is a key ingredient. While this ingredient is feasible to compute for $\mathrm{GSp}(4,\mathbb{F}_{\ell})$ for any small prime $\ell$, the problem of distinguishing Gassmann-equivalent subgroups is delicate. We accomplish it for $\ell = 3$, using a combination of techniques. The algorithm does not require knowledge of the endomorphism ring.<br>

		A bielliptic surface (or hyperelliptic surface) is a smooth surface with a numerically trivial canonical divisor such that the Albanese morphism is an elliptic fibration. In the first part of this paper, we study the structure of bielliptic surfaces over a field of characteristic different from $2$ and $3$, in order to prove the Shafarevich conjecture for bielliptic surfaces with rational points. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Shafarevich conjecture generally fails for bielliptic surfaces without rational points. In particular, this paper completes the study of the Shafarevich conjecture for minimal surfaces of Kodaira dimension $0$.
  In the second part of this paper, we study a N\'{e}ron model of a bielliptic surface. We establish the potential existence of a N\'{e}ron model for a bielliptic surface when the residual characteristic is not equal to $2$ or $3$.<br>

		The moduli space of $8$ points on $\mathbb{P}^1$, a so-called ancestral Deligne-Mostow space, is, by work of Kond\={o}, also a moduli space of K3 surfaces. We prove that the Deligne-Mostow isomorphism does not lift to a morphism between the Kirwan blow-up of the GIT quotient and the unique toroidal compactification of the corresponding ball quotient. Moreover, we show that these spaces are not $K$-equivalent, even though they are natural blow-ups at the unique cusps and have the same cohomology. This is analogous to the work of Casalaina-Martin-Grushevsky-Hulek-Laza on the moduli space of cubic surfaces. The moduli spaces of ordinary stable maps, that is, the Fulton-MacPherson compactification of the configuration space of points on $\mathbb{P}^1$, play an important role in the proof. We further relate our computations to new developments in the minimal model program and recent work of Odaka. We briefly discuss other cases of moduli space of points on $\mathbb{P}^1$ where a similar behaviour can be observed, hinting at a more general, but not yet fully understood phenomenon.<br>

		Given a matrix $A$ with integer entries, a subset $S$ of an abelian group and $r \in \mathbb N$, we say that $S$ is $(A,r)$-Rado if any $r$-colouring of $S$ yields a monochromatic solution to the system of equations $Ax=0$. A classical result of Rado characterises all those matrices $A$ such that $\mathbb N$ is $(A,r)$-Rado for all $r \in \mathbb N$. R\"odl and Ruci\'nski and Friedgut, R\"odl and Schacht proved a random version of Rado's theorem where one considers a random subset of $[n]:=\{1,\dots,n\}$ instead of $\mathbb N$.
  In this paper, we investigate the analogous random Ramsey problem in the more general setting of abelian groups. Given a sequence $(S_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of finite subsets of abelian groups, let $S_{n,p}$ be a random subset of $S_n$ obtained by including each element of $S_n$ independently with probability $p$. We are interested in determining the probability threshold $\hat p:=\hat p(n)$ such that
  $$\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb P [ S_{n,p} \text{ is } (A,r)\text{-Rado}]= \begin{cases} 0 &\text{ if } p=o(\hat p); \\ 1 &\text{ if } p=\omega(\hat p). \end{cases}$$
  Our main result, which we coin the random Rado lemma, is a general black box to tackle problems of this type. Using this tool in conjunction with a series of supersaturation results, we determine the probability threshold for a number of different cases. A consequence of the Green-Tao theorem is the van der Waerden theorem for the primes: every finite colouring of the primes contains arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions. Using our machinery, we obtain a random version of this result. We also prove a novel supersaturation result for $S_n:=[n]^d$ and use it to prove an integer lattice generalisation of the random version of Rado's theorem. Various threshold results for abelian groups are also given.<br>

		Let G be a connected reductive group over a non-archimedean local field. We say that an irreducible depth-zero (complex) G-representation is non-singular if its cuspidal support is non-singular. We establish a Local Langlands Correspondence for all such representations. We obtain it as a specialization from a categorical version: an equivalence between the category of finite-length non-singular depth-zero G-representations and the category of finite-length right modules of a direct sum of twisted affine Hecke algebras constructed from Langlands parameters. We also show that our LLC and our equivalence of categories have several nice properties, for example compatibility with parabolic induction.<br>

		In this paper we study the category of nuclear modules on an affine formal scheme as defined by Clausen and Scholze \cite{CS20}. We also study related constructions in the framework of dualizable and rigid monoidal categories. We prove that the $K$-theory (in the sense of \cite{E24}) of the category of nuclear modules on $\operatorname{Spf}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ is isomorphic to the classical continuous $K$-theory, which in the noetherian case is given by the limit $\varprojlim\limits_{n} K(R/I^n).$ This isomorphism was conjectured previously by Clausen and Scholze.
  More precisely, we study two versions of the category of nuclear modules: the original one defined in \cite{CS20} and a different version, which contains the original one as a full subcategory. For our category $\operatorname{Nuc}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ we give three equivalent definitions. The first definition is by taking the internal $\operatorname{Hom}$ in the category $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}$ of $R$-linear dualizable categories. The second definition is by taking the rigidification of the usual $I$-complete derived category of $R.$ The third definition is by taking an inverse limit in $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}.$ For each of the three approaches we prove that the corresponding construction is well-behaved in a certain sense.
  Moreover, we prove that the two versions of the category of nuclear modules have the same $K$-theory, and in fact the same finitary localizing invariants.<br>
