		For a given integer $m$ and any residue $a \pmod{m}$ that can be written as a sum of 3 squares modulo $m$, we show the existence of infinitely many integers $n \equiv a \pmod{m}$ such that the number of representations of $n$ as a sum of three squares, $r_3(n)$, satisfies $r_3(n) \gg_m \sqrt{n} \log \log n$. Consequently, we establish that there are infinitely many integers $n \equiv a \pmod{m}$ for which the Hurwitz class number $H(n)$ also satisfies $H(n) \gg_m \sqrt{n} \log \log n$.</div>

		Let $n,d$, and $k$ be positive integers where $n$ and $d$ are coprime. Our two main results are
  Theorem 1. There is a partition of the infinite interval $[kd,\infty)$ of positive integers into a family of finite sets $X$ for which the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in $X$ is $n/d$.
  Theorem 1. There is a partition of $[2kd,\infty)$ into an infinite family of infinite sets $Y$ for which the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in $Y$ is $n/d$.
  Our method is grounded in the Vital Identity, $1/z = 1/(z+1) + 1/z(z+1)$, which holds for every complex number $z \notin \{-1,0\}$, and which gives rise to an eponymous algorithm that serves as our tool. At the core of our Theorems 1 and 2 is the number theoretic function $\star: x\mapsto \star x := x(x+1)$ into whose properties this paper continues an investigation initiated in [7].</div>

The second was held at NSU IMS in Singapore, June 3-7, 2024, as part of "Computational Aspects of Thin Groups", and was titled "Integral packings and number theory". Both courses were put together by a number theorist for students and researchers in other fields. They cover a web of ideas relating to Apollonian circle packings, integral orbits, thin groups, hyperbolic geometry, continued fractions, and Diophantine approximation.

		Our main result in this article is a proof (under mild technical assumptions) of an analogue for $p$-adic Galois representations attached to a newform $f$ of even weight $k\geq4$ of Kolyvagin's conjecture on the $p$-indivisibility of derived Heegner points on elliptic curves, where $p$ is a prime number that is ordinary for $f$. Our strategy, which is inspired by work of W. Zhang in weight $2$, is based on a variant for modular forms of the congruence method originally introduced by Bertolini-Darmon to prove one divisibility in the anticyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for rational elliptic curves. We adapt to higher (even) weight modular forms this approach via congruences, building crucially on results of Wang on the indivisibility of Heegner cycles over Shimura curves. Then we offer an application of our results on Kolyvagin's conjecture to the Tamagawa number conjecture for the motive of $f$ and describe other (standard) consequences on structure theorems for Bloch-Kato-Selmer groups, $p$-parity results and converse theorems for $f$. Since in the present paper we need $p>k+1$, our main theorem and its applications can be viewed as complementary to results obtained by the first and third authors in their article on the Tamagawa number conjecture for modular motives, where Kolyvagin's conjecture was proved (in a completely different way exploiting the arithmetic of Hida families) under the assumption that $k$ is congruent to $2$ modulo $2(p-1)$, which forces $p<k$. In forthcoming work, we will use results contained in this paper to prove (under analogous assumptions) the counterpart for an even weight newform $f$ of Perrin-Riou's Heegner point main conjecture for elliptic curves ("Heegner cycle main conjecture" for $f$).</div>

		A real number is called simply normal to base $b$ if every digit $0,1,\ldots ,b-1$ should appear in its $b$-adic expansion with the same frequency $1/b$. A real number is called normal to base $b$ if it is simply normal to every base $b, b^2, \ldots$. In this article, we discover a relation between the normality of algebraic numbers and a mean of the Riemann zeta function on vertical arithmetic progressions. Consequently, we reveal that a positive algebraic irrational number $\alpha$ is normal to base $b$ if and only if we have \[ \lim_{N\to \infty}\frac{1}{\log N} \sum_{1\leq |n|\leq N} \zeta\left(-k+\frac{2\pi i n}{\log b} \right) \frac{e^{2\pi i n \log \alpha /\log b}}{n^{k+1}} =0 \] for every integer $k\geq 0$.</div>

		In our previous works we proved a finiteness property of the radii of convergence functions associated with a vector bundle with connection on $p$-adic analytic curves. We showed that the radii are locally constant functions outside a locally finite graph in the curve, called controlling graph. In this paper we refine that finiteness results by giving a bound on the size of the controlling graph in terms of the geometry of the curve and the rank of the module. This is based on super-harmonicity properties of radii of convergence and partial heights of the Newton polygon. Under suitable assumptions, we relate the size of the controlling graph associated with the total height of the convergence Newton polygon to the Euler characteristic in the sense of de Rham cohomology.</div>

		We study densities of $p$-adically bounded primes for hypergeometric series in two cases: the case of generalized hypergeometric series with rational parameters, and the case of $_2F_1$ with parameters in a quadratic extension of the rational numbers. In the rational case we extend work from $_2F_1$ to $_nF_{n-1}$ for an exact formula giving the density of bounded primes for the series. The density is shown to be one exactly in accordance with the case of finite monodromy as classified by Beukers-Heckmann. In the quadratic irrational case, we obtain an unconditional lower bound on the density of bounded primes. Assuming the normality of the $p$-adic digits of quadratic irrationalities, this lower bound is shown to be an exact formula for the density of bounded primes. In the quadratic irrational case, there is a trivial upper bound of $1/2$ on the density of bounded primes. In the final section of the paper we discuss some results and computations on series that attain this bound. In particular, all such examples we have found are associated to imaginary quadratic fields, though we do not prove this is always the case.</div>

		The Ceresa cycle is a canonical algebraic $1$-cycle on the Jacobian of an algebraic curve.

Under the hypothesis that the Sato--Tate group is the whole of $\operatorname*{GSp}$, we prove that if the Ceresa class (the image of the Ceresa cycle in \'{e}tale cohomology) is non-torsion, then the algorithm will eventually terminate with a certificate attesting to this fact.</div>

		In this paper, we research more in depth properties of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (recently designed by the third author), when used to find roots of meromorphic functions.
  If $f=P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials in 1 complex variable z with $deg (P)>deg (Q)$, we show the existence of an exceptional set $\mathcal{E}\subset\mathbf{C}$, which is contained in a countable union of real analytic curves in $\mathbf{R}^2=\mathbf{C}$, so that the following statements A and B hold. Here, $\{z_n\}$ is the sequence constructed by BNQN with an initial point $z_0$, not a pole of $f$.
  A) If $z_0\in\mathbb{C}\backslash\mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a root of $f$.
  B) If $z_0\in \mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point - but not a root - of $f$.
  Experiments seem to indicate that in general, even when $f$ is a polynomial, the set $\mathcal{E}$ is not contained in a finite union of real analytic curves. We provide further results relevant to whether locally $\mathcal{E}$ is contained in a finite number of real analytic curves. A similar result holds for general meromorphic functions. Moreover, unlike previous work, here we do not require that the parameters of BNQN are random, or that the meromorphic function $f$ is generic.
  Based on the theoretical results, we explain (both rigorously and heuristically) of what observed in experiments with BNQN, in previous works by the authors. The dynamics of BNQN seems also to have some similarities (and differences) to the classical Leau-Fatou's flowers.</div>

		Let $p$ be a prime number, $K$ a finite unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $\mathbb{F}$ a finite extension of $\mathbb{F}_p$. Using perfectoid spaces we associate to any finite-dimensional continuous representation $\overline{\rho}$ of ${\rm Gal}(\overline K/K)$ over $\mathbb{F}$ an \'etale $(\varphi,\mathcal{O}_K^\times)$-module $D_A^\otimes(\overline{\rho})$ over a completed localization $A$ of $\mathbb{F}[\![\mathcal{O}_K]\!]$. We conjecture that one can also associate an \'etale $(\varphi,\mathcal{O}_K^\times)$-module $D_A(\pi)$ to any smooth representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_2(K)$ occurring in some Hecke eigenspace of the mod $p$ cohomology of a Shimura curve, and that moreover $D_A(\pi)$ is isomorphic (up to twist) to $D_A^\otimes(\overline{\rho})$, where $\overline{\rho}$ is the underlying $2$-dimensional representation of ${\rm Gal}(\overline K/K)$.

We introduce the notion of $L^2$-jump product and obtain a weighted Plancherel identity for {\rm BV} functions. As a corollary, we get a newfound characterization of sets of finite perimeter in terms of their Fourier transform. Moreover, we sharpen a result of Herz on the set-theoretic derivative of the Fourier transform of characteristic functions of sets.

		We prove a sharp upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors in $\mathbb{R}^m$ using dynamics on homogeneous spaces, specifically the method of integral inequalities. Together with the lower bound proved recently by Kim and Park \cite{KimPark2024}, this determines the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors, thereby generalizing to arbitrary dimension, the work of Liao, Shi, Solan, and Tamam \cite{LSST}, who determined the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors in two dimensions. We also provide the first known bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors restricted to fractal subsets.</div>

		The elements of a finite field of prime order canonically correspond to the integers in an interval. This induces an ordering on the elements of the field. Using this ordering, Kiss and Somlai recently proved interesting properties of the set of points below the diagonal line. In this paper, we investigate the set of points lying below a parabola. We prove that in some sense, this set of points looks the same from all but two directions, despite having only one non-trivial automorphism. In addition, we study the sizes of these sets, and their intersection numbers with respect to lines.</div>

		Let $b_{t,k}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular partitions of $n$, where $t\geq 2$ and $k\geq 1$. Recently, Singh and Barman proved that $b_{3,2}(n)\geq b_{2,2}(n)$ for all $n\geq 4$. They also conjectured that $b_{t+1,2}(n)\geq b_{t,2}(n)$ for $t\geq 3$ and for all $n\geq 0$. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture is true for $t=3$.</div>
