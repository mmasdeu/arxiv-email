		Let $x$ and $n$ be positive integers. We prove a non-trivial lower bound for $x$, dependant only on $\omega_n$, the number of distinct prime factors of $x^n-1$. By considering the divisibility of $\varphi \mid x^n-1$ for $\varphi \mid n$, we obtain a further refinement.

		Linear harmonic number sums had been studied by a variety of authors during the last centuries, but only few results are known about nonlinear Euler sums of quadratic or even higher degree. The first systematic study on nonlinear Euler sums consisting of products of hyperharmonic sums had been published by Flajolet and Salvy in 1997 followed by similar studies presented during the last years by different authors. Although these studies had been restricted to sums where the nominator consists of a product of even or odd hyperharmonic sums, where the denominator is of the type $1/k^n$. We have generalized these results to nonlinear Euler sums with different denominators and nominators which consist in addition of mixed products between even and odd hyperharmonic numbers. In detail we present eight families of quadratic Euler sums which are expressible by zeta values and special types of linear Euler sums only where the order of the nonlinear Euler sums is always an odd number. The resulting eight different families of nonlinear Euler sums which we discovered consist of various products between even and odd hyperharmonic numbers, divided by three different types of denominators $1/k^n$, $1/((2k-1)^n)$ and $1/(k(2k-1))$. The calculational scheme is based on proper two-valued integer functions, which allow us to compute these sequences explicitly in terms of zeta values and pairs of odd-type linear harmonic numbers and even hyperharmonic numbers of second order.</div>

		We relate the structure of the Bloch-Kato groups associated with a de Rham Galois representation over a perfectoid field to the Galois theory of the ring $\mathbf{B}_\mathrm{dR}^+$ of $p$-adic periods. As an application, we answer the question raised by Coates and Greenberg and motivated by Iwasawa theory to compute the Bloch-Kato groups over perfectoid fields in new cases, generalising results of Coates and Greenberg and the author. Our method relies on the classification of vector bundles over the Fargues-Fontaine curve.</div>

		We treat the functions $\star^k:{\mathbf N}\rightarrow{\mathbf N}$ where $\star:x\mapsto \star x := x(x+1)$. The set $\{\star^k x: \{x,k\}\subset{\mathbf N}\}$ offers a short and direct proof that the set of primes is infinite. We introduce the ``mother sequence,'' M, obtained by factoring into prime powers the terms of $2,3,4,\ldots$. For each $x\ge2$ we introduce the infinite sequence $x^\star$ obtained by factoring the terms of the ``gross $x$-sequence,'' $\gamma_\star(x) :=\langle x+1;\star x+1;\star^2x+1;\star^3x+1;\ldots\rangle$, into prime powers. It turns out that $\gamma_\star(1)$ is Sylvester's sequence, A00058 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences - OEIS, and that $\gamma_\star(2)$ is the sequence A082732 in the OEIS.
  Theorem 2. For some integers $x\ge1$ there are primes that are factors of no member of $\{\star^kx: k\ge0\}$.
  Theorem 3. For each $x\ge2$ there is are infinitely many infinite subsequences ${\sf c}_j$ of M such that $x^\star = {\sf c}_j$ and such that the infinite family of term sets in M of those ${\sf c}_j$ is pairwise disjoint.</div>

		In the present work, we extend current research in a nearly-forgotten but newly revived topic, initiated by P. A. MacMahon, on a generalized notion which relates the divisor sums to the theory of integer partitions and two infinite families of $q$-series by Ramanujan. Our main emphasis will be on explicit representations for a variety of $q$-series, studied primarily by MacMahon and Ramanujan, with an eye towards their modular properties and their proper place in the ring of quasimodular forms of level one and level two.</div>

		This research provides a formal definition of the arithmetic theta lift for cusp forms of weight $3/2$ and establishes the arithmetic inner product formula, thereby completing the Kudla program on modular curves. This formula is demonstrated to be equivalent to the Gross-Zagier formula, for which we provide a new proof.
  Additionally, the authors introduce a new arithmetic representation for the central derivatives of L-functions associated with cusp forms of higher weight. Although this representation differs from Zhang's higher weight Gross-Zagier formula, it maintains a significant connection to it. This study also proposes a conjecture indicating that the vanishing of derivatives of L-functions is determined by the algebraicity of the coefficients of harmonic weak Maass forms.
  A consistent approach is employed to study both parts of this work.</div>

		The research in the subfield of analytic number theory around error term of summation of sigma functions possesses a history which can be dated back to the mid-19th century when Dirichlet provided an $O(\sqrt{n})$ estimation of error term of summation of $d(n)$. Later, G. Voronoi, G. Kolesnik, and M.N. Huxley (to name just a few) contributed more on the upper bound on the error term of summation of sigma functions. As for $\Omega$-theorems, G.H. Hardy was the first contributor. Later researchers on this topic include G.H. Hardy and T.H. Gronwall, but the amount of academic effort is much sparser than $O$-theorems. This research aims to provide a better $\Omega$-bound for the error term of summation of fractional sigma function $\sigma_{\alpha}(n)$ on the range $0 < \alpha < \frac{1}{2}$, obtaining the result $\Omega((x \ln x)^{\frac{1}{4}+\frac{\alpha}{2}})$.</div>

In the four-variable case, we further study the relationship between the Mahler measure and special values of $L$-functions of $K3$ surfaces. The method involves a construction of an element in the motivic cohomology of $K3$ surfaces. We apply our method to the exact polynomial $(x+1)(y+1)(z+1) + t$.</div>

		The van der Geer-van der Vlugt curves are Artin-Schreier coverings of the affine line defined by linearized polynomials over finite fields. We give several criteria for them to be maximal or minimal, i.e. attaining the upper or lower bound in the Hasse-Weil inequalities. We also study the $L$-polynomials of certain generalizations of van der Geer-van der Vlugt curves. As applications, we find several maximal (or minimal) curves among them. Our proof is based on an explicit formula of $L$-polynomials recently obtained by Takeuchi and the third author.</div>

		Letting $L_{n}(N, u)$ denote a polylogarithm ladder of weight $n$ and index $N$ with $u$ as an algebraic number, there is a rich history surrounding how mathematical objects of this form can be constructed for a given weight or index. This raises questions as to what minimal polynomials for $u$ are permissible in such constructions. Classical relations for the dilogarithm $\text{Li}_{2}$ provide families of weight-2 ladders in such a way so that the base equations for $u$ consist of a fixed number of terms, and subsequent constructions for dilogarithm ladders rely on sporadic cases whereby $u$ is defined via a cyclotomic equation, as in the supernumary ladders due to Abouzahra and Lewin. This motivates our construction of an infinite family of dilogarithm ladders so as to obtain arbitrarily many terms with nonzero coefficients for the minimal polynomials for $u$. Our construction relies on a derivation of a dilogarithm identity introduced by Khoi in 2014 via the Seifert volumes of manifolds obtained from the use of Dehn surgery.</div>

In particular, we prove an analogue of Iwasawa's class number formula and that of Kida's formula for compatible systems of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^d$-covers of weighted graphs.

		We develop a version of the Kloosterman circle method with a bump function that is used to provide asymptotics for weighted representation numbers of nonsingular integral quadratic forms. Unlike many applications of the Kloosterman circle method, we explicitly state some constants in the error terms that depend on the quadratic form. This version of the Kloosterman circle method uses Gauss sums, Kloosterman sums, Sali\'{e} sums, and a principle of nonstationary phase.

However, generically the more complicated Artin $L$-series will make their appearance.

These examples are related to a mod-2 congruence for $X_0(11)$, respectively a mod-59 congruence for $\Delta E_4$ conjectured by Serre and Swinnerton-Dyer and proved by Haberland.

This filtration is obtained by suitably gluing $r$-copies of the usual Nygaard filtration and corresponds to the $\xi_r$-adic filtration on $\mathbb{A}_{\mathrm{inf}}$, in the case that $S$ is a perfectoid ring.
  Using this, we study the motivic filtration of topological restriction homology $\mathrm{TR}^r (S;\mathbb{Z}_p)$ and of its $S^1$-homotopy fixed points. We also pursue connections with the theory of topological cyclic homology. Finally we discuss connections with the de Rham--Witt complex, towards a prismatic - de Rham--Witt comparison theorem.</div>

		In this paper, we give a new explanation of congruences of Eisenstein series of level $\Gamma_1(N)$ and character $\chi$. Our approach is based on Katz's algebro-geometric explanation of $p$-adic congruences of normalized Eisenstein series $E_{2k}$ of level $1$. One crucial step in our argument is to reformulate a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence in Katz's explanation in terms of Dieudonn\'e theory of height $1$ formal $A$-modules and their finite subgroup schemes. We give a generalization of this Riemann-Hilbert correspondence in terms of formal groups of height greater than $1$.</div>

		In this work, we present algebraic results concerning the combined matrices $\mathcal{C}(A)$, where the entries of $A$ belong to a number field $K$ and $A$ is a non-singular matrix. In other words, $A$ is a $n\times n$ matrix belonging to the General Linear Group over $K$, denoted by $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$. We also analyze the case in which matrix $A$ belongs to algebraic subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$, such as the unimodular group, where $A^2$ is a $n\times n$ matrix belonging to the Special Linear Group, denoted by $\mathrm{SL}_n(K)$, triangular groups, diagonal groups, among others. In particular, we thouroughly examine the cases $n=2$ and $n=3$ for symmetric and non-symmetric matrices, providing explicit diagonalization of $\mathcal{C}(A)$, which includes characteristic polynomials with their eigenvalues and eigenfactors.</div>

		This paper contributes to the theory of orders of number fields. This paper defines a notion of "ray class group" associated to an arbitrary order in a number field together with an arbitrary ray class modulus for that order (including Archimedean data), constructed using invertible fractional ideals of the order. It shows existence of "ray class fields" corresponding to the class groups. These ray class groups (resp., ray class fields) specialize to classical ray class groups (resp., fields) of a number field in the case of the maximal order, and they specialize to ring class groups (resp., fields) of orders in the case of trivial modulus. The paper gives exact sequences for simultaneous change of order and change of modulus. As a consequence, we identify the ray class field of an order with a given modulus as a specific subfield of a ray class field of the maximal order with a larger modulus. We also uniquely describe each ray class field of an order in terms of the splitting behavior of primes.</div>

		Let $q$ be an integer. A $D(q)$-$m$-tuple is a set of $m$ distinct positive integers ${a_1, a_2, . . . , a_m}$ such that $a_ia_j + q$ is a perfect square for all $1 \leq i < j \leq m$. By counting integer solutions $x \in [1, b]$ of congruences $x^2 \equiv q (\mod b)$ with $b \leq N$, we count $D(q)$-pairs with both elements up to $N$, and give estimates on asymptotic behaviour. We show that for prime $q$, the number of such $D(q)$-pairs and $D(q)$-triples grows linearly with $N$. Up to a factor of $2$, the slope of this linear function is the quotient of the value of the $L$-function of an appropriate Dirichlet character (usually a Kronecker symbol) and of $\zeta(2)$.</div>

		We calculate murmuration densities for two families of Dirichlet characters. The first family contains complex Dirichlet characters normalized by their Gauss sums. Integrating the first density over a geometric interval yields a murmuration function compatible with experimental observations. The second family contains real Dirichlet characters weighted by a smooth function with compact support. We show that the second density exhibits a universality property analogous to Zubrilina's density for holomorphic newforms, and it interpolates the phase transition in the the $1$-level density for a symplectic family of $L$-functions.</div>

		We use Iwasawa theory, at a prime $p$ inert in a quadratic imaginary field $K$, to study the arithmetic properties of mock plectic invariants for elliptic curves of rank two. More precisely, under some minor technical assumptions, we prove that the non-vanishing of the mock plectic invariant $\mathcal{Q}_K$ attached to an elliptic curve $E_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ of even analytic rank $r_\mathrm{an}(E/K)\ge2$, and with multiplicative reduction at $p$, implies that the $p$-Selmer rank $r_p(E/K)$ equals $2$. The proof rests on one inclusion of Perrin-Riou's Heegner point main conjecture for elliptic curves with multiplicative reduction at $p$ which we obtain using bipartite Euler systems.</div>

		P. Erd\H{o}s conjectured in 1962 that on the ring $\mathbb{Z}$, every set of $n$ congruence classes in $\mathbb{Z}$ that covers the first $2^n$ posotive integers also covers the ring $\mathbb{Z}$.

		A (1+1)D unitary bosonic rational conformal field theory (RCFT) may be organized according to its genus, a tuple $(c,\mathscr{C})$ consisting of its central charge $c$ and a unitary modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$ which describes the (2+1)D topological quantum field theory (TQFT) for which its maximally extended chiral algebra forms a holomorphic boundary condition. We establish a number of results pertaining to RCFTs in "small" genera, by which we informally mean genera with the central charge $c$ and the number of primary operators rank$(\mathscr{C})$ both not too large. We start by completely solving the modular bootstrap problem for theories with at most four primary operators. In particular, we characterize, and provide an algorithm which efficiently computes, the function spaces to which the partition function of any bosonic RCFT with rank$(\mathscr{C})\leq 4$ must belong. Using this result, and leveraging relationships between RCFTs and holomorphic vertex operator algebras which come from "gluing" and cosets, we rigorously enumerate all bosonic theories in $95$ of the $105$ genera $(c,\mathscr{C})$ with $c\leq 24$ and rank$(\mathscr{C})\leq 4$. This includes as (new) special cases the classification of chiral algebras with three primaries and $c<120/7\sim 17.14$, and the classification of chiral algebras with four primaries and $c<62/3\sim 20.67$. We then study two applications of our classification. First, by making use of chiral versions of bosonization and fermionization, we obtain the complete list of purely left-moving fermionic RCFTs with $c<23$ as a corollary of the results of the previous paragraph. Second, using a (conjectural) concept which we call "symmetry/subalgebra duality," we precisely relate our bosonic classification to the problem of determining certain generalized global symmetries of holomorphic vertex operator algebras.</div>

Our aim here is to study the integers $N$ for which the minimal monomial solutions satisfying some fixed conditions have an irreducibility property. In particular, we will classify the monomially irreducible integers which are the integers for which all the nonzero minimal monomial solutions are irreducible.</div>
