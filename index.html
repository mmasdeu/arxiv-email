		Integer geometry on a plane deals with objects whose vertices are points in $\mathbb Z^2$. The congruence relation is provided by all affine transformations preserving the lattice $\mathbb Z^2$.

		Let $q$ be a Pisot or Salem number.

		The classification of maximal function fields over a finite field is a difficult open problem, and even determining isomorphism classes among known function fields is challenging in general. We study a particular family of maximal function fields defined over a finite field with $q^2$ elements, where $q$ is the power of an odd prime. When $d := (q+1)/2$ is a prime, this family is known to contain a large number of non-isomorphic function fields of the same genus and with the same automorphism group. We compute the automorphism group and isomorphism classes also in the case where $d$ is not a prime.</div>

		Let $p$ be a prime number and $q$ a power of $p$. Let $\fq$ be the finite field with $q$ elements. For a positive integer $n$ and a polynomial $\varphi(X)\in\fq[X]$, let $d_{n,\varphi}(X)$ denote the denominator of the $n$th iterate of $\frac{1}{\varphi(X)}$.

In this paper, we characterize a class of inversely stable polynomials over $\fq$. Actually, for $\varphi(X)=X^p-X+\xi\in\fq[X]$, we provide a sufficient and necessary condition for $\varphi(X)$ to be inversely stable over $\fq$.</div>

		K{\"o}hler, in [1], presented a weight 1 newform on $\Gamma_0(576)$ constructed from a linear combination of weight 1 eta quotients and asked, ``What would be a suitable $L$ and representation $\rho$ such that Deligne\text{-}Serre correspondence holds?"

We also discuss an exotic newform on $\Gamma_0(1080)$ constructed from a linear combination of weight 1 eta quotients, find the corresponding Galois extension and representation, and study the splitting of primes in this extension. Furthermore, we find all such newforms that can be constructed from a linear combination of weight 1 eta quotients listed in [2] with $q$-expansion of the form $q+\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}a(k)q^k$.</div>

As an application, we give another proof of the analytic properties for the twisted Koecher-Maass series.

		Many articles have recently been devoted to Mahler equations, partly because of their links with other branches of mathematics such as automata theory. Hahn series (a generalization of the Puiseux series allowing arbitrary exponents of the indeterminate as long as the set that supports them is well-ordered) play a central role in the theory of Mahler equations. In this paper, we address the following fundamental question: is there an algorithm to calculate the Hahn series solutions of a given linear Mahler equation? What makes this question interesting is the fact that the Hahn series appearing in this context can have complicated supports with infinitely many accumulation points. Our (positive) answer to the above question involves among other things the construction of a computable well-ordered receptacle for the supports of the potential Hahn series solutions.</div>

		The Hidden Subset Sum Problem (HSSP) involves reconstructing a hidden set from its multiple subset sums. Initially introduced as a cryptographic problem of accelerating the key generation process in some public key cryptosystems, it has recently found applications in artificial intelligence privacy-preserving research. Although the existing algorithms based on the orthogonal lattice attack perform well in certain cryptographic applications, they are not effective for addressing all instances of HSSP. In this work, we focus on designing deterministic algorithms for a special case of HSSP: For a hidden multiset $X=\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}$ with elements in $\mathbb{R}$ and an integer $k\in(1,n)$, given the multiset $X_{n,k}$ consisting of all $k$-subset sum of $X$, the goal is to recover $X$. Such a problem is called the $(n,k)$-complete HSSP. Two kinds of deterministic algorithms will be proposed in this work. The first one is a brute-force search approach. In the second one, we recover $X$ by finding all the roots of the $n$-th degree polynomial whose roots are exactly the elements of $X$. We show that the coefficients of such a polynomial can be calculated from $X_{n,k}$. In addition, discussions pertaining to the Stirling partition number and the ring of homogeneous symmetric polynomials are of independent interest.</div>

		In 2007, Andrews and Paule introduced the family of functions $\Delta_k(n)$, which enumerate the number of broken $k$-diamond partitions for a fixed positive integer $k$. In 2013, Radu and Sellers completely characterized the parity of $\Delta_3(8n + r)$ for some $r$ and gave a conjecture on congruences modulo powers of 2 for broken 3-diamond partitions. We use an unconventional $U$-sequence to solve the revised conjecture proposed by Radu and Sellers.</div>

		Proper continued fractions are generalized continued fractions with positive integer numerators $a_i$ and integer denominators with $b_i\geq a_i$. In this paper we study the strength of approximation of irrational numbers to their convergents and classify which pairs of integers $p,q$ yield a convergent $p/q$ to some irrational $x$. Notably, we reduce the problem to finding convergence only of index one and two. We completely classify the possible choices for convergents of odd index and provide a near-complete classification for even index. We furthermore propose a natural two-dimensional generalization of the classical Gauss map as a method for dynamically generating all possible expansions and establish ergodicity of this map.</div>

		Let $p$ be an odd prime. We give an unconditional proof of the equivariant Iwasawa main conjecture for totally real fields for every admissible one-dimensional $p$-adic Lie extension whose Galois group has an abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup. Crucially, this result does not depend on the vanishing of any $\mu$-invariant.

		Asymptotics are given for the number of rational points in the domain of a morphism of weighted projective stacks whose images have bounded height and satisfy a (possibly infinite) set of local conditions. As a consequence we obtain results for counting elliptic curves over number fields with prescribed level structures, including the cases of $\Gamma(N)$ for $N\in\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, $\Gamma_1(N)$ for $N\in\{1,2,\dots,10,12\}$, and $\Gamma_0(N)$ for $N\in\{1,2,4,6,8,9,12,16,18\}$. In all cases we give an asymptotic with an expression for the leading coefficient, and in many cases we also give a power-saving error term.</div>

		To each Galois extension $L/K$ of number fields with Galois group $G$ and each integer $r \leq 0$ one can associate Stickelberger elements in the centre of the rational group ring $\mathbb{Q}[G]$ in terms of values of Artin $L$-series at $r$. We show that the denominators of their coefficients are bounded by the cardinality of the commutator subgroup $G'$ of $G$ whenever $G$ is nilpotent. Moreover, we show that, after multiplication by $|G'|$ and away from $2$-primary parts, they annihilate the class group of $L$ if $r=0$ and higher Quillen $K$-groups of the ring of integers in $L$ if $r<0$. This generalizes recent progress on conjectures of Brumer and of Coates and Sinnott from abelian to nilpotent extensions.
  For arbitrary $G$ we show that the denominators remain bounded along the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-tower of $L$ for every odd prime $p$. This allows us to give an affirmative answer to a question of Greenberg and of Gross on the behaviour of $p$-adic Artin $L$-series at zero.</div>

		Let $R(z,q)$ be the two-variable generating function of Dyson's rank function. In a recent joint work with Frank Garvan, we investigated the transformation of the elements of the $p$-dissection of $R(\zeta_p,q)$, where $\zeta_p$ is a primitive $p$-th root of unity, under special congruence subgroups of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, leading us to interesting symmetry observations. In this work, we derive analogous transformation results for the two-variable crank generating function $C(z,q)$ in terms of generalized eta products. We consider the action of the group $\Gamma_0(p)$ on the elements of the $p$-dissection of $C(z,q)$, leading us to new symmetries for the crank function. As an application, we give a new proof of the crank theorem predicted by Dyson in 1944 and resolved by Andrews and Garvan in 1988. Furthermore, we present identities expressing the elements of the crank dissection in terms of generalized eta products for primes $p=11,13,17$ and $19$.</div>

		In this paper we study the (classical) Frobenius problem, namely the problem of finding the largest integer that cannot be represented as a nonnegative integral combination of given relatively prime (strictly) positive integers (known as the Frobenius number). The main contribution of this paper are observations regarding a previously known upper bound on the Frobenius number where, in particular, we observe that a previously presented argument features a subtle error, which alters the value of the upper bound. Despite this, we demonstrate that the subtle error does not impact upon on the validity of the upper bound, although it does impact on the upper bounds tightness. Notably, we formally state the corrected result and additionally compare the relative tightness of the corrected upper bound with the original. In particular, we show that the updated bound is tighter in all but only a relatively "small" number of cases using both formal techniques and via Monte Carlo simulation techniques.</div>

		Let $k =\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of $q$ elements and $E$ an elliptic curve over $k$ given by the equation $f(x,y) = 0$. Let $k[E]$ be the affine coordinate ring and $k(E)$ the field of fractions. We fix a place $\infty$ of $k(E)$ and let $k_{\infty}$ be the completion. The group ${\rm{GL}}_2(k[E])$ acts on the symmetric space $\mathcal{T}$, the Bruhat-Tits building of ${\rm{PGL}}_2(k_{\infty})$. In this paper, we use the quotient space to construct the space of modular symbols over $K(E)$. We prove that this space is given by an explicit set of generators and their relations.</div>

		In this paper, we explore the modular differential equation $\displaystyle y'' + F(z)y = 0$ on the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H}$, where $F$ is a weight 4 modular form for $\Gamma_0(2)$. Our approach centers on solving the associated Schwarzian equation $\displaystyle \{h, z\} = 2F(z)$, where $\{h, z\}$ represents the Schwarzian derivative of a meromorphic function $h$ on $\mathbb{H}$. We derive conditions under which the solutions to this equation are modular functions for subgroups of the modular group and provide explicit expressions for these solutions in terms of classical modular functions. Key tools in our analysis include the theory of equivariant functions on the upper half-plane and the representation theory of level 2 subgroups of the modular group.</div>

		A famous conjecture of Chowla on the least primes in arithmetic progressions implies that the abscissa of convergence of the Weil representation zeta function for a procyclic group $G$ only depends on the set $S$ of primes dividing the order of $G$ and that it agrees with the abscissa of the Dedekind zeta function of $\mathbb{Z}[p^{-1}\mid p \not\in S]$.

		It is well known that there is a somewhat mysterious relation between the area of the quartic Fermat curve $x^4+y^4=1$, aka squircle, and the arc length of the lemniscate $(x^2+y^2)^2=x^2-y^2$. The standardproof of this fact uses relations between elliptic integrals and the gamma function. In this article we generalize this result to relate areas of sectors of the squircle to arc lengths of segments of the lemniscate. We provide a geometric interpretation of this relation and an elementary proof of the relation, which only uses basic integral calculus. We also discuss an alternate version of this kind of relation, which is implicit in a calculation of Siegel.</div>
